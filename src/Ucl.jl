"""
This  module gives information  about the unipotent  conjugacy classes of a
connected  reductive  group  over  an  algebraically  closed field `k`, and
various  invariants attached to  them. The unipotent  classes depend on the
characteristic of `k`; their classification differs when the characteristic
is  not *good*  (that is,  when it  divides one  of the coefficients of the
highest  root).  In  good  characteristic,  the  unipotent  classes  are in
bijection with nilpotent orbits on the Lie algebra.

We  give  the  following  information  for  a unipotent element `u` of each
class:

- the centralizer ``C_𝐆 (u)``, that we describe by the reductive part of
  ``C_𝐆  (u)^0``, by the  group of components  ``A(u):=C_𝐆 (u)/C_𝐆 (u)^0``,
  and by the dimension of its radical.

- in good characteristic, the  Dynkin-Richardson  diagram.

- the Springer correspondence,  attaching characters of  the Weyl group or
  relative Weyl groups to each character of `A(u)`.

The  Dynkin-Richarson diagram is  attached to a  nilpotent element ``e`` of
the  Lie algebra  ``𝔤``. By  the Jacobson-Morozov  theorem there  exists an
``𝔰𝔩₂`` subalgebra of ``𝔤`` containing ``e`` as the element
``\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\0&0  \\end{pmatrix}``.  Let  ``𝐒``  be  the  torus
``\\begin{pmatrix}h&0\\\\0&h^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}`` of ``SL₂`` and let ``𝐓``
be  a  maximal  torus  containing  ``𝐒``,  so  that ``𝐒`` is the image of a
one-parameter   subgroup  ``σ∈  Y(𝐓)``.  Consider  the  root  decomposition
``𝔤=∑_{α∈Φ}𝔤_α``  given by ``𝐓`` and the  root system `Φ`; then ``α↦⟨σ,α⟩``
defines  a linear form  on ``Φ``, determined  by its value  on simple roots
`Π`.  It is possible to choose a  system of simple roots such that ``⟨σ,α⟩≥
0``  for ``α∈Π``,  and then  ``⟨σ,α⟩∈{0,1,2}`` for  any ``α∈Π``. The Dynkin
diagram  of  ``Π``  decorated  by  these  values  ``0,1,2``  is  called the
Dynkin-Richardson  diagram  of  ``e``,  and  in  good  characteristic  is a
complete invariant of its ``𝔤``-orbit.

Another  classification of unipotent  elements was given  by Bala-Carter. A
standard  parabolic subgroup `𝐏` of `𝐆`  parameterised by a subset `I⊂Π` is
*distinguished*  if the linear form `σ` taking the value `2` for `α∈ I` and
`0` for other simple roots satisfies `2n₀+semisimplerank(𝐆)=n₂`, where `nᵢ`
is  the number  of roots  in `Φ`  where `σ`  takes the  value `i`.  Given a
distinguished  parabolic `𝐏`,  there is  a unique  unipotent class which is
dense  in the  unipotent radical  of `𝐏`.  This class  has the  linear form
described  by the  Dynkin-Richardson diagram  equal to  `σ`. Such unipotent
classes  are called *distinguished*.  The theorem of  Bala-Carter says that
every  unipotent class is  distinguished in the  smallest Levi subgroup `𝐋`
which  contains  it,  and  that  such  pairs  of  `𝐋` and the distinguished
parabolic  `𝐏`  of  `𝐋`  taken  up  to  `𝐆`-conjugacy are in bijection with
unipotent classes of `𝐆`.

Let  ``ℬ`` be  the variety  of all  Borel subgroups  and let  ``ℬᵤ`` be the
subvariety  of Borel subgroups  containing the unipotent  element `u`. Then
``dim C_𝐆(u)=rank 𝐆 + 2 dim ℬ_u`` and in good characteristic this dimension
can  be computed from  the Dynkin-Richardson diagram:  the dimension of the
class of `u` is the number of roots `α` such that ``⟨σ,α⟩∉{0,1}``.

We   now  describe  the  Springer  correspondence.  Indecomposable  locally
constant  ``𝐆``-equivariant  sheaves  on  a  unipotent  class ``C``, called
*local  systems*, are  parameterised by  irreducible characters of ``A(u)``
for  `u∈ C`. The *ordinary* Springer  correspondence is a bijection between
irreducible  characters of the Weyl  group and a large  subset of the local
systems  containing all trivial  local systems (those  parameterised by the
trivial  character  of  ``A(u)``  for  each  ``u``).  More  generally,  the
*generalised*  Springer correspondence  associates to  each local  system a
(unique  up to ``𝐆``-conjugacy) *cuspidal pair* of a Levi subgroup ``𝐋`` of
``𝐆``  and a *cuspidal* local  system on an unipotent  class of ``𝐋``, such
that  the  set  of  local  systems  associated  to a given cuspidal pair is
parameterised  by the characters of the  relative Weyl group ``W_𝐆 (𝐋):=N_𝐆
(𝐋)/𝐋``.  There are only few cuspidal pairs  (at most one in each dimension
for classical groups).

The  Springer correspondence gives information on the character values of a
finite  reductive groups  as follows:  assume that  ``k`` is  the algebraic
closure  of a finite field ``𝔽_q`` and that ``F`` is the Frobenius attached
to  an ``𝔽_q``-structure of  ``𝐆``. Let ``C``  be an ``F``-stable unipotent
class  and let ``u∈ C^F``; we call ``C`` the *geometric class* of ``u`` and
the ``𝐆^F``-classes inside ``C^F`` are parameterised by the ``F``-conjugacy
classes  of ``A(u)``, denoted ``H¹(F,A(u))`` (most  of the time we can find
``u`` such that ``F`` acts trivially on ``A(u)`` and ``H¹(F,A(u))`` is then
just the conjugacy classes). To an ``F``-stable character ``φ`` of ``A(u)``
we  associate  the  *characteristic  function*  of  the corresponding local
system (actually associated to an extension ``φ̃`` of ``φ`` to ``A(u).F``);
it  is a class function  ``Y_{u,φ}`` on ``𝐆^F`` which  can be normalized so
that:  ``Y_{u,φ}(u₁)=φ̃(cF)`` if ``u₁`` is geometrically conjugate to ``u``
and  its ``𝐆^F``-class is parameterised by the ``F``-conjugacy class ``cF``
of  ``A(u)``, otherwise ``Y_{u,φ}(u₁)=0``. If  the pair ``u,φ`` corresponds
via  the Springer correspondence to the character ``χ`` of ``W_𝐆(𝐋)``, then
``Y_{u,φ}``  is also  denoted ``Yᵪ``.  There is  another important class of
functions  indexed by local  systems: to a  local system on  class ``C`` is
attached  an intersection cohomology complex, which is a complex of sheaves
supported on the closure ``C̄``. To such a complex of sheaves is associated
its  *characteristic  function*,  a  class  function of ``𝐆^F`` obtained by
taking  the alternating trace of the Frobenius  acting on the stalks of the
cohomology  sheaves. If ``Y_ψ``  is the characteristic  function of a local
system,  the  characteristic  function  of  the  corresponding intersection
cohomology  complex is  denoted by  ``X_ψ``. This  function is supported on
``C̄``,  and Lusztig has shown that ``X_ψ=∑ᵩ P_{ψ,χ} Yᵪ`` where ``P_{ψ,χ}``
are  integer polynomials in ``q`` and  ``Yᵪ`` are attached to local systems
on classes lying in ``C̄``.

Lusztig   and  Shoji  have  given  an   algorithm  to  compute  the  matrix
``P_{ψ,χ}``,  which is implemented in Chevie. The relation to characters of
``𝐆(𝔽_q)``,    considering   for    simplicity   the    ordinary   Springer
correspondence,  is that the  restriction to the  unipotent elements of the
almost  character ``R_χ`` is equal to  ``q^{bᵪ} Xᵪ``, where ``bᵪ`` is ``dim
ℬᵤ``  for an element `u` of  the class `C` such that  the support of `χ` is
``C̄``.  The restrictions of the Deligne-Lusztig characters ``R_w`` for `w∈
W`  on the  unipotents are  called the  *Green functions*  and can  also be
computed  by Chevie.  The values  of all  unipotent characters on unipotent
elements  can also be  computed in principle  by applying Lusztig's Fourier
transform  matrix (see the  section on the  Fourier matrix) but  there is a
difficulty  in that the  ``Xᵪ`` must first  be multiplied by  some roots of
unity  which are not known  in all cases (and  when known may depend on the
congruence class of ``q`` modulo some small primes).

Finally,  we describe  how unipotent  classes of  `𝐆` are  parameterised in
various   quasisimple  groups.   In  classical   types,  the   classes  are
parametrised by partitions corresponding to the Jordan form in the standard
representation. Thus,

  - for `Aₙ` we have partitions of `n+1`.
  - for  `B_n` we have partitions of `2n+1`  where even parts occur an even
    number  of times. In characteristic  2, types B and  C are isogenous so
    have the same classification; thus see the next paragraph.
  - for  `C_n` we  have partitions  of `2n`  where odd  parts occur an even
    number  of times. In characteristic 2,  there are `2ᵏ` classes attached
    to  a partition where  `k` is the  number of even  parts which occur an
    even number of times.
  - for  `D_n` we have partitions of `2n`  where even parts occur an even
    number  of times,  excepted there  are two  classes when  all parts are
    even.  In characteristic 2, we have  partitions of `2n` where odd parts
    occur  an  even  number  of  times,  excepted  there are `2ᵏ+δ` classes
    attached  to a partition  where `k` is  the number of  even parts which
    occur an even number of times, and `δ` is 2 when all parts are even and
    0 otherwise.
In  exceptional  groups,  the  names  of  the  classes are derived from the
Bala-Carter classification. The name for a class parametrised by `(𝐋,𝐏)` is
of  the form `l(p)`  where `l` is  the name of  `𝐋` and `(p)` is present if
there  is more than one distinguished  parabolic in `𝐋` and describes which
one  it  is.  Before  the  classification  of  Bala-Carter  was universally
adopted,  Shoji and Mizuno used a  different scheme where sometimes a class
was  parametrised by a reductive  subgroup of maximal rank  which was not a
Levi.  These  older  labels  can  be  obtained  instead  by giving the `IO`
property  `:shoji=>true` or  `:mizuno=>true`. In  a bad characteristic `p`,
there  are extra classes. Each of them is associated to a class `c` in good
characteristic and is named `(c)ₚ`.

We illustrate the above descriptions on some examples:

```julia-repl
julia> UnipotentClasses(rootdatum(:sl,4))
UnipotentClasses(sl₄)
1111<211<22<31<4
   u│D-R dBu B-C     C(u) A₃(Φ₁³) A₁(A₁×A₁Φ₁)/-1 .(A₃)/ζ₄ .(A₃)/ζ₄³

211 │101   3 2..  q⁵.A₁Φ₁  Id:211
1111│000   6 ...       A₃ Id:1111

```
The first column of the table gives the name of the unipotent class, here a
partition  describing  the  Jordan  form.  The  partial  order on unipotent
classes  given by  Zariski closure  is given  before the  table. The column
`D-R`,   which   is   only   shown   in   good  characteristic,  gives  the
Dynkin-Richardson  diagram  for  each  class;  the  column  `dBu` gives the
dimension  of the variety  ``ℬ ᵤ``. The  column `B-C` gives the Bala-Carter
classification of ``u``, that is in the case of ``sl₄`` it shows ``u`` as a
regular  unipotent  in  a  Levi  subgroup  by  giving the Dynkin-Richardson
diagram  of a regular unipotent (all  2's) for the entries corresponding to
the  Levi and `.` for the entries  which not corresponding to the Levi. The
column `C(u)` describes the group ``C_𝐆(u)``: a power ``qᵈ`` describes that
the  unipotent  radical  of  ``C_𝐆(u)``  has  dimension  ``d`` (thus ``qᵈ``
rational  points); then follows a description  of the reductive part of the
neutral  component of ``C_𝐆(u)``, given by the name of its root datum. Then
if  ``C_𝐆(u)`` is not connected, the description of ``A(u)`` is given using
a  different vocabulary: a cyclic group of order  4 is given as `Z4`, and a
symmetric group on 3 points would be given as `S3`.

For  instance, the first class `4`  has ``C_𝐆(u)^0`` unipotent of dimension
`3` and ``A(u)`` equal to `Z4`, the cyclic group of order 4. The class `22`
has  ``C_G(u)`` with unipotent radical of  dimension `4`, reductive part of
type  `A1` and ``A(u)`` is  `Z2`, that is the  cyclic group of order 2. The
other  classes have ``C_𝐆(u)`` connected. For  the class `31` the reductive
part of ``C_G(u)`` is a torus of rank 1.

Then  there is one column for each *Springer series*, giving for each class
the  pairs  'a:b'  where  'a'  is  the  name  of  the character of ``A(u)``
describing  the local system involved and 'b'  is the name of the character
of  the (relative) Weyl group corresponding by the Springer correspondence.
At  the top of the  column is written the  name of the relative Weyl group,
and  in brackets the  name of the  Levi affording a  cuspidal local system;
next,  separated  by  a  `/`  is  a  description  of  the central character
associated  to the  Springer series  (omitted if  this central character is
trivial):   all  local  systems  in  a  given  Springer  series  have  same
restriction  to the center of  ``𝐆``. To find what  the picture becomes for
another algebraic group in the same isogeny class, for instance the adjoint
group,  one  simply  discards  the  Springer series whose central character
becomes  trivial on the center of ``𝐆``;  and each group ``A(u)`` has to be
quotiented  by the common  kernel of the  remaining characters. Here is the
table for the adjoint group:

```julia-repl
julia> UnipotentClasses(coxgroup(:A,3))
UnipotentClasses(A₃)
1111<211<22<31<4
   u│D-R dBu B-C    C(u) A₃(Φ₁³)
────┼────────────────────────────
4   │222   0 222      q³    Id:4
31  │202   1 22.   q⁴.Φ₁   Id:31
22  │020   2 2.2   q⁴.A₁   Id:22
211 │101   3 2.. q⁵.A₁Φ₁  Id:211
1111│000   6 ...      A₃ Id:1111
```

Here is another example:

```julia-repl
julia> UnipotentClasses(coxgroup(:G,2))
UnipotentClasses(G₂)
1<A₁<Ã₁<G₂(a₁)<G₂
     u│D-R dBu B-C  C(u)         G₂(Φ₁²)  .(G₂)
──────┼─────────────────────────────────────────
G₂    │ 22   0  22    q²         Id:φ₁‚₀
G₂(a₁)│ 20   1  20 q⁴.S₃ 21:φ′₁‚₃ 3:φ₂‚₁ 111:Id
Ã₁    │ 01   2  .2 q³.A₁         Id:φ₂‚₂
A₁    │ 10   3  2. q⁵.A₁        Id:φ″₁‚₃
1     │ 00   6  ..    G₂         Id:φ₁‚₆
```

which illustrates that on class `G₂(a₁)` there are two local systems in the
principal  series of  the Springer  correspondence, and  a further cuspidal
local system. It also illustrates how we display in general the Bala-Carter
classification.  If a class is attached to `(𝐋,𝐏)` then the simple roots in
the  complement of `𝐋` have  a `.`. Those in  `𝐋` have a `0`  or a `2`, the
`2`s  characterizing  `𝐏`.  So,  from  the  `B-C`  column, we see that that
`G₂(a₁)`  is not in  a proper Levi,  in which case  the Bala-Carter diagram
coincides with the Dynkin-Richardson diagram.

The  characteristics 2 and  3 are not  good for `G2`.  To get the unipotent
classes  and the Springer correspondence in bad characteristic, one gives a
second argument to the function `UnipotentClasses`:

```julia-repl
julia> UnipotentClasses(coxgroup(:G,2),3)
UnipotentClasses(G₂,3)
1<A₁,(Ã₁)₃<Ã₁<G₂(a₁)<G₂
     u│dBu B-C  C(u)  G₂(Φ₁²) .(G₂) .(G₂)  .(G₂)
──────┼──────────────────────────────────────────
G₂    │  0  22 q².Z₃   1:φ₁‚₀       ζ₃:Id ζ₃²:Id
G₂(a₁)│  1  20 q⁴.Z₂   2:φ₂‚₁ 11:Id
Ã₁    │  2  .2    q⁶  Id:φ₂‚₂
A₁    │  3  2. q⁵.A₁ Id:φ″₁‚₃
(Ã₁)₃ │  3  ?? q⁵.A₁ Id:φ′₁‚₃
1     │  6  ..    G₂  Id:φ₁‚₆
```

The  function `ICCTable` gives the  transition matrix between the functions
``Xᵪ``  and ``Y_ψ``.

```julia-repl
julia> uc=UnipotentClasses(coxgroup(:G,2));
julia> t=ICCTable(uc)
Coefficients of Xᵪ on Yᵩ for series L=G₂₍₎=Φ₁² W_G(L)=G₂
      │G₂ G₂(a₁)⁽²¹⁾ G₂(a₁) Ã₁ A₁  1
──────┼──────────────────────────────

Xφ₁‚₆ │ .          .      .  .  .  1
```

An example which illustrates how to get the `shoji` names of classes
```julia-rep1
julia> uc=UnipotentClasses(coxgroup(:F,4));

julia> uc.classes[10:end]
7-element Vector{UnipotentClass}:
 UnipotentClass(C₃(a₁))
 UnipotentClass(F₄(a₃))
 UnipotentClass(C₃)
 UnipotentClass(B₃)
 UnipotentClass(F₄(a₂))
 UnipotentClass(F₄(a₁))
 UnipotentClass(F₄)

julia> xdisplay(uc.classes[10:end],shoji=true)
7-element Vector{UnipotentClass}:
 UnipotentClass(A₁+B₂)
 UnipotentClass(A₃+Ã₁)
 UnipotentClass(C₃)
 UnipotentClass(B₃)
 UnipotentClass(C₃+A₁)
 UnipotentClass(B₄)
 UnipotentClass(F₄)
```

Here  the row labels  and the column  labels show the  two ways of indexing
local systems: the row labels give the character of the relative Weyl group
and  the column labels give the class and the name of the local system as a
character  of `A(u)`: for instance, `G2(a1)` is the trivial local system of
the  class `G2(a1)`, while  `G2(a1)(21)` is the  local system on that class
corresponding to the 2-dimensional character of ``A(u)=A₂``.

The  data on unipotent classes for  arbitrary reductive groups are obtained
as  follows. The  data for  a quasi-simple  simply connected group `𝔾` have
been entered by hand for each type. In such a group to each Springer series
is  attached a character of `A(Z)`, the  group of components of the center.
For  any reductive group `𝔾'`  of the same type  with center `Z'` the group
`A(Z')` is a quotient of the group `A(Z)`. The Springer series for `𝔾'` are
those  such  that  the  corresponding  character  of `A(Z)` factors through
`A(Z')`   (for  computing  `A(Z')`   see  [`algebraic_center`](@ref)).  The
geometric  unipotent classes of  `𝔾` and `𝔾'`  are in bijection.  For `u` a
unipotent  element  of  `𝔾'`  (which  we  can  consider also as a unipotent
element  of `𝔾`) the group  `A₁=A(u)` in `𝔾'` is  a quotient of `A=A(u)` in
`𝔾`  that we can  compute as follows:  the Springer correspondence for `𝔾'`
tells us which characters of `A` survive in `𝔾'`. Then `A'` is the quotient
of `A` by the common kernel of these characters.

`induced_linear_form(W, K, h)`

This routine can be used to find the class in the algebraic group `𝐆` which
contains  a given unipotent  class of a  reductive subgroup of maximum rank
`𝐊` of `𝐆`.

The  argument `h` is a linear form on  the roots of `𝐊`, given by its value

`0`  on the orthogonal of the roots  of `K`; and finally the resulting form

`UnipotentClasses(W[,p])`

`W`  should  be  a  `CoxeterGroup`  record  for a Weyl group or `RootDatum`
describing a reductive algebraic group `𝐆`. The function returns a record
containing   information   about   the   unipotent   classes  of  `𝐆`  in
characteristic   `p`  (if   omitted,  `p`   is  assumed   to  be  any  good
characteristic for `𝐆`). This contains the following fields:

`group`: a pointer to `W`

`p`: the characteristic of the field for which the unipotent classes were
computed. It is `0` for any good characteristic.

`orderclasses`:  a list describing the Hasse diagram of the partial order
induced   on   unipotent   classes   by   the  closure  relation.  That  is
`.orderclasses[i]`  is the list of `j` such that ``C̄ⱼ⊋ C̄ᵢ``  and  there  is
no  class  ``Cₖ``  such  that ``C̄ⱼ⊋ C̄ₖ⊋ C̄ᵢ``.

`classes`:  a  list  of  records  holding information for each unipotent
class (see below).

`springerseries`:  a list of records, each  of which describes a Springer
series  of `𝐆`.

The  records  describing  individual  unipotent  classes have the following
fields:

`name`: the name of the unipotent class.

`parameter`:  a parameter  describing the  class (for  example, a partition
describing the Jordan form, for classical groups).

`Au`: the group `A(u)`.

`dynkin`:  present in good characteristic; contains the Dynkin-Richardson
diagram,  given  as  a  list  of  0,1,2  describing  the coefficient on the
corresponding simple root.

`red`:  the reductive part of ``C_𝐆(u)``.

`dimBu`:  the dimension of the variety `𝓑ᵤ`.

The  records for classes contain additional  fields for certain groups: for
instance,  the names given to classes by Mizuno in `E₆, E₇, E₈` or by Shoji
in `F₄`. See the help for `UnipotentClass` for more details.

The  records  describing  individual  Springer  series  have  the following
fields:

`levi`:the  indices of the  reflections corresponding to  the Levi subgroup
`𝐋`  where  lives  the  cuspidal  local  system `ι` from which the Springer
series is induced.

`relgroup`: The relative Weyl group ``N_𝐆(𝐋,ι)/𝐋``. The first series is the
principal series for which `.levi=[]` and `.relgroup=W`.

`locsys`:  a  list  of  length  `nconjugacy_classes(.relgroup)`, holding in
`i`-th  position a  pair describing  which local  system corresponds to the
`i`-th  character of  ``N_𝐆(𝐋,ι)``. The  first element  of the  pair is the
index  of the concerned unipotent class `u`, and the second is the index of
the corresponding character of `A(u)`.

`Z`:  the central character associated  to the Springer series, specified
by its value on the generators of the center.

The  `show`  function  for  unipotent  classes  accepts  all the options of
`formatTable`  and  of  `charnames`.  Giving  the  option  `mizuno`  (resp.
`shoji`)  uses  the  names  given  by  Mizuno  (resp.  Shoji) for unipotent
classes.  Moreover,  there  is  also  an  option  `fourier` which gives the
Springer  correspondence tensored with the  sign character of each relative
Weyl  group,  which  is  the  correspondence obtained via a Fourier-Deligne
transform  (here  we  assume  that  `p`  is  very  good, so that there is a
nondegenerate  invariant bilinear form on the Lie algebra, and also one can
identify nilpotent orbits with unipotent classes).

Here is how to display the non-cuspidal part of the Springer correspondence
of  the unipotent  classes of  `E₆` using  the notations  of Mizuno for the
classes  and those  of Frame  for the  characters of  the Weyl group and of
Spaltenstein  for the characters  of `G₂` (this  is convenient for checking
our data with the original paper of Spaltenstein):

"""
`ICCTable(uc,seriesNo=1;q=Pol())`

This function gives the table of decompositions of the functions ``X_ι`` in
terms  of the functions ``Y_ι``. Here `ι` is a `𝐆`-equivariant local system
on  the  class  `C`  of  a  unipotent  element  `u`. Such a local system is
parametrised  by the pair  `(u,ϕ)` of `u`  and a character  of the group of
components   `A(u)`   of   ``C_𝐆   (u)``.   The  function  ``Y_ι``  is  the
characteristic   function  of  this   local  system  and   ``X_ι``  is  the
characteristic   function  of  the  corresponding  intersection  cohomology
complex  on `C̄`. The  Springer correspondence says  that the local systems
can  also be  indexed by  characters of  a relative  Weyl group.  Since the
coefficient of `Xᵪ` on `Yᵩ` is `0` if `χ` and `φ` are not characters of the
same  relative Weyl group (are not in  the same Springer series), the table
is  for one  Springer series,  specified by  the argument  'seriesNo' (this
defaults  to 'seriesNo=1' which is the principal series). The decomposition
multiplicities  are graded,  and are  given as  polynomials in one variable
(specified by the argument `q`; if not given `Pol()` is assumed).

```julia-repl
julia> uc=UnipotentClasses(coxgroup(:A,3));t=ICCTable(uc)
Coefficients of Xᵪ on Yᵩ for series L=A₃₍₎=Φ₁³ W_G(L)=A₃

X22  │.  .  1   1   Φ₄
X211 │.  .  .   1   Φ₃
X1111│.  .  .   .    1
```
In  the  above  the  multiplicities  are  given  as  products of cyclotomic
polynomials  to display them  more compactly. However  the format of such a
table can be controlled more precisely.

For  instance,  one  can  ask  to  not  display  the entries as products of
cyclotomic polynomials and not display the zeroes as '.'

```julia-rep1
julia> xdisplay(t;cycpol=false,dotzero=false)
Coefficients of Xᵪ on Yᵩ for A3
     │4 31 22 211   1111

X211 │0  0  0   1 q²+q+1
X1111│0  0  0   0      1
```

Since `show` uses the function `format` for tables, all the options of this
function  are  also  available.  We  can  use  this to restrict the entries
displayed  to a  given sublist  of the  rows and  columns (here the indices
correspond  to the number  in Chevie of  the corresponding character of the
relative Weyl group of the given Springer series):

The   function  'ICCTable'  returns  an   object  with  various  pieces  of
information which can help further computations.

`.scalar`:  this contains the table of  multiplicities `Pᵪᵩ` of the `Xᵪ` on
the  `Yᵩ`.  One  should  pay  attention  that  by default, the table is not
displayed  in the same order as the  stored |.scalar|, which is in order in
Chevie  of  the  characters  in  the  relative  Weyl  group;  the  table is
transposed,  then lines  and rows  are sorted  by `dimBu,class  no,index of
character in A(u)` while displayed.

`.group`: The group `W`.

`.relgroup`: The relative Weyl group for the Springer series.

`.series`: The index of the Springer series given for `W`.

`.dimBu`: The list of ``dimℬᵤ`` for each local system `(u,φ)` in the series.

`:L`:  The matrix of (unnormalized) scalar products of the functions ``Yᵩ``
with  themselves,  that  is  the  ``(φ,χ)``  entry  is ``∑_{g∈𝐆(𝔽_q)} Yᵩ(g)
Yᵪ(g)``. This is thus a symmetric, block-diagonal matrix where the diagonal
blocks  correspond to geometric unipotent conjugacy classes. This matrix is
obtained as a by-product of Lusztig's algorithm to compute ``Pᵩᵪ``.

`XTable(uc;classes=false)`

This  function presents  in a  different way  the information obtained from
`ICCTable`. Let ``X̃_{u,ϕ}=q^{1/2(codim C-dim Z(𝐋 ))}X_{u,ϕ}`` where `C` is
the  class of `u` and `Z(𝐋 )` is the center of Levi subgroup on which lives
the cuspidal local system attached to the local system `(u,ϕ)`.

Then  `XTable(uc)` gives the decomposition of the functions ``X̃_{u,ϕ}`` on
local   systems.  `t=XTable(uc,classes==true)`  gives  the  values  of  the
functions   ``X̃_{u,ϕ}``   on   unipotent   classes.   A   side  effect  of
`classes=true`  is  to  compute  the  cardinal  of  the unipotent conjugacy
classes,  avalaible in `t.cardClass`; in this case displaying `t` will show
the  cardinal  of  the  centralizers  of  unipotent  elements, available in
`t.centClass`.

`GreenTable(uc;classes=false)`

Keeping the same notations as in the description of 'XTable', this function
returns a table of the functions ``Q_{wF}``, attached to elements ``wF∈ W_𝐆
(𝐋)⋅F`` where ``W_𝐆 (𝐋)`` are the relative weyl groups attached to cuspidal
local  systems.  These  functions  are  defined  by ``Q_{wF}=∑_{u,ϕ} ϕ̃(wF)
X̃_{u,ϕ}``. An point to note is that in the principal Springer series, when
`𝐓`  is  a  maximal  torus,  the  function  ``Q_{wF}``  coincides  with the
Deligne-Lusztig  character ``R^𝐆  _{𝐓_W}(1)``. As  for 'XTable', by default
the  table  gives  the  values  of  the  functions  on  local  systems.  If
`classes=true`  is  given,  then  it  gives  the  values  of  the functions
``Q_{wF}`` on conjugacy classes.

The  functions ``Q_{wF}`` depend only on the conjugacy class of `wF`, so in
the  first column the indices of 'Q' are the names of the conjugacy classes
of ``W_𝐆(𝐋)``. The exponents are the names of the groups ``W_𝐆(𝐋)``.

'special_pieces(<uc>)'

The  special  pieces  forme  a  partition  of  the  unipotent  variety of a
reductive  group `𝐆` which was defined  the first time in [Spaltenstein1982
chap.  III](biblio.htm#spalt82)  as  the  fibers  of  `d^2`, where `d` is a
"duality  map". Another definition is as the  set of classes in the Zariski
closure  of a special class  and not in the  Zariski closure of any smaller
special  class, where  a special  class in  the support  of the  image of a
special character by the Springer correspondence.

Each  piece is a union of unipotent  conjugacy classes so is represented in
Chevie  as a  list of  class numbers.  Thus the  list of  special pieces is
returned  as  a  list  of  lists  of  class  numbers. The list is sorted by
increasing  piece dimension, while each piece is sorted by decreasing class
dimension, so the special class is listed first.

```julia-repl
julia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)
G₂

julia> special_pieces(UnipotentClasses(W))
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1]
 [4, 3, 2]
 [5]

julia> special_pieces(UnipotentClasses(W,3))
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1]
 [4, 3, 2, 6]
 [5]
```

The   example  above  shows  that  the  special  pieces  are  different  in
characteristic 3.
