"""
Let  ``𝐆 `` be a connected reductive  group over the algebraic closure of a
finite  field ``𝔽_q``,  defined over  ``𝔽_q`` with  corresponding Frobenius
automorphism  ``F``. We  want to  study the  irreducible characters  of ``𝐆
^F``.  More generally we consider ``𝐆 ^F`` where ``F`` is an isogeny of ``𝐆
``  such  that  a  power  is  a  Frobenius  (this covers the Suzuki and Ree
groups).

If  ``𝐓`` is an ``F``-stable  maximal torus of ``𝐆  ``, and ``𝐁`` is a (not
necessarily  ``F``-stable) Borel  subgroup containing  ``𝐓``, we define the
*Deligne-Lusztig*  variety ``X_𝐁=\\{g𝐁 ∈ 𝐆  /𝐁 ∣ g𝐁 ∩  F(g𝐁 )≠∅ \\}``. This
variety  affords  a  natural  action  of  ``𝐆  ^F``  on  the  left,  so the
corresponding   *Deligne-Lusztig  virtual  module*  ``H^*_c(X_𝐁):=∑ᵢ  (-1)ⁱ
Hⁱ_c(X_𝐁,ℚ̄  _ℓ)``  also.  The  (virtual)  character  of this module is the
*Deligne-Lusztig*  character  ``R_𝐓  ^𝐆  (1)``;  the  notation reflects the
theorem  that this character does  not depend on the  choice of ``𝐁``. This
character  can be  parameterized by  an ``F``-conjugacy  class of ``W``: if
``𝐓₀⊂𝐁₀``  is an ``F``-stable pair, there is an unique ``w∈ W=N_𝐆 (𝐓₀)/𝐓₀``
such  that the triple ``(𝐓,𝐁,F)`` is ``𝐆 ``-conjugate to ``(𝐓₀,𝐁₀,wF)``. We
will  thus denote ``R_w`` for ``R_𝐓^𝐆 (1)``; this character depends only on
the ``F``-class of ``w``.

The  *unipotent characters* of ``𝐆 ^F`` are the irreducible constituents of
the  ``R_w``. In a similar way that the Jordan decomposition shows that the
unipotent classes are a building block for describing the conjugacy classes
of  a  reductive  group,  Lusztig  has  defined  a  Jordan decomposition of
characters  where  the  unipotent  characters  are  the building block. The
unipotent  characters are parameterized by  combinatorial data that Lusztig
has  defined just  from the  coset ``Wφ``,  where `φ`  is the  finite order
automorphism  of ``X(𝐓₀)``  such that  ``F=qφ``. Thus,  from our viewpoint,
unipotent  characters  are  objects  combinatorially  attached to a Coxeter
coset.

A  subset  of  the  unipotent  characters, the *principal series* unipotent
characters,  can  be  described  in  a  more  elementary  way. They are the
constituents  of  ``R₁``,  or  equivalently  the  characters of the virtual
module  ``H^*_c(X_{𝐁 ₀})``, where ``X_{𝐁 ₀}``  is the discrete variety ``(𝐆
/𝐁₀)^F``;  this virtual module reduces to the actual module ``ℚ̄ _ℓ[(𝐆 /𝐁₀)
^F]``.  Thus  the  Deligne-Lusztig  induction  ``R_{𝐓₀}^𝐆  (1)`` reduces to
Harish-Chandra  induction, defined  as follows:  let ``𝐏  =𝐔 ⋊  𝐋 ``  be an
``F``-stable  Levi decomposition  of an  ``F``-stable parabolic subgroup of
``𝐆  ``. Then the *Harish-Chandra* induced  ``R_𝐋^𝐆 `` of a character ``χ``
of  ``𝐋^F`` is  the character  ``Ind_{𝐏^F}^{𝐆 ^F}χ̃``,  where ``χ̃`` is the
lift  to ``𝐏^F`` of ``χ`` via the quotient ``𝐏^F/𝐔 ^F=𝐋^F``; Harish-Chandra
induction  is a  particular case  of *Lusztig  induction*, which is defined
when ``𝐏`` is not ``F``-stable using the variety ``X_𝐔 =\\{ g𝐔 ∈𝐆 /𝐔 ∣ g𝐔 ∩
F(g𝐔  )≠∅\\}``, and gives for an  ``𝐋^F``-module a virtual ``𝐆 ^F``-module.
Like  ordinary induction, these  functors have adjoint  functors going from
representations   of   ``𝐆   ^F``   to   representations   (resp.   virtual
representations)   of  ``𝐋^F``  called  Harish-Chandra  restriction  (resp.
Lusztig restriction).

The  commuting algebra of ``𝐆^F``-endomorphisms of ``R₁=R_{𝐓₀}^𝐆(1)`` is an
Iwahori-Hecke  algebra for ``W^φ``, with parameters some powers of `q`; the
parameters  are  all  equal  to  `q`  when ``W^φ=W``. Thus principal series
unipotent characters are parametrized by characters of ``W^φ``.

To   understand  the  decomposition  of  more  general  ``R_w``,  and  thus
parameterize unipotent characters, is is useful to introduce another set of
class  functions which are  parameterized by irreducible  characters of the
coset  ``Wφ``.  If  ``χ``  is  such  a  character, we define the associated
*almost  character* by:  ``Rᵪ=|W|⁻¹∑_{w∈ W}χ(wφ)  R_w``. The  name reflects
that these class function are close to irreducible characters. They satisfy
``⟨Rᵪ,  R_ψ⟩_{𝐆^F}=δ_{χ,ψ}``;  for  the  linear  and unitary group they are
actually  unipotent characters (up to sign in the latter case). They are in
general the sum (with rational coefficients) of a small number of unipotent
characters in the same *Lusztig family*, see [`Families`](@ref). The degree
of  ``Rᵪ``  is  a  polynomial  in  ``q``  equal  to  the fake degree of the
character ``χ`` of ``Wφ`` (see [`fakedegree`](@ref)).

We   now  describe  the  parameterization   of  unipotent  characters  when
``W^φ=W``,  thus when the coset ``Wφ`` identifies with ``W`` (the situation
is  similar  but  a  bit  more  difficult  to  describe  in  general).  The
(rectangular) matrix of scalar products ``⟨ρ, Rᵪ⟩_{𝐆 ^F}``, when characters
of  ``W``  and  unipotent  characters  are  arranged in the right order, is
block-diagonal   with  rather  small  blocks   which  are  called  *Lusztig
families*.

For the characters of ``W``  a family `𝓕` corresponds  to a block of the
Hecke  algebra  over  a  ring  called  the  Rouquier ring. To `𝓕` Lusztig
associates  a small group ``Γ`` (not  bigger than ``(ℤ/2)ⁿ``, or ``𝔖ᵢ`` for
``i≤5``) such that the unipotent characters in the family are parameterized
by the pairs ``(x,θ)`` taken up to ``Γ``-conjugacy, where ``x∈Γ`` and ``θ``
is  an irreducible character of ``C_Γ(x)``.  Further, the elements of `𝓕`
themselves are parameterized by a subset of such pairs, and Lusztig defines
a  pairing  between  such  pairs  which  computes  the scalar product ``⟨ρ,
Rᵪ⟩_{𝐆^F}``,  called  the  *Lusztig  Fourier  matrix*. For more details see
[`drinfeld_double`](@ref).

A  second parameterization  of unipotent  character is  via *Harish-Chandra
series*.  A character is called *cuspidal* if all its proper Harish-Chandra
restrictions  vanish. There are few  cuspidal unipotent characters (none in
``GLₙ``  for  ``n>1``,  and  at  most  one  in other classical groups). The
``𝐆^F``-endomorphism algebra of an Harish-Chandra induced
``R_{𝐋^F}^{𝐆^F}λ``, where ``λ`` is a cuspidal unipotent character turns out
to be a Hecke algebra associated to the group
``W_{𝐆^F}(𝐋^F):=N_{𝐆^F}(𝐋)/𝐋``, which turns out to be a Coxeter group. Thus
another  parameterization  is  by  triples  ``(𝐋,λ,φ)``,  where  ``λ`` is a
cuspidal  unipotent  character  of  ``𝐋^F``  and  ``φ``  is  an irreducible
character  of the  *relative group*  ``W_{𝐆^F}(𝐋^F)``. Such  characters are
said to belong to the Harish-Chandra series determined by ``(𝐋,λ)``.

A  final  piece  of  information  attached  to  unipotent characters is the
*eigenvalues of Frobenius*. Let ``Fᵟ`` be the smallest power of the isogeny
``F``  which  is  a  split  Frobenius  (that  is, ``Fᵟ`` is a Frobenius and
``φᵟ=1``). Then ``Fᵟ`` acts naturally on Deligne-Lusztig varieties and thus
on  the  corresponding  virtual  modules,  and  commutes  to  the action of
``𝐆^F``;  thus for  a given  unipotent character  ``ρ``, a submodule of the
virtual  module which  affords ``ρ``  affords a  single eigenvalue ``μ`` of
``Fᵟ``. Results of Lusztig and Digne-Michel show that this eigenvalue is of
the  form ``qᵃᵟλᵨ``  where ``2a∈ℤ``  and ``λᵨ``  is a  root of  unity which
depends  only on ``ρ`` and not the considered module. This ``λᵨ`` is called
the  eigenvalue of Frobenius attached to ``ρ``. Unipotent characters in the
Harish-Chandra  series  of  a  pair  ``(𝐋,λ)``  have the same eigenvalue of
Frobenius as ``λ``.

This  package  contains  tables  of  all  this information, and can compute
Harish-Chandra  and Lusztig  induction of  unipotent characters  and almost
characters. We illustrate this on some examples:

```julia-repl

```

The  first column gives  the name of  the unipotent character, derived from
its  Harish-Chandra  classification;  the  first  6  characters  are in the
principal  series  so  are  named  by  characters  of  `W`.  The last 4 are
cuspidal,  and named by the corresponding eigenvalue of Frobenius, which is
displayed  in the fourth  column. For classical  groups, the Harish-Chandra
data can be synthesized combinatorially to give a *symbol*.

The  first two characters are  each in a Lusztig  family by themselves. The
last  eight are in a family associated to the group `Γ=𝔖₃`: the last column
shows  the parameters  `(x,θ)`. The  third column  shows the  degree of the
unipotent characters, which is transformed by the Lusztig Fourier matrix of
the  third  column,  which  gives  the  degree  of the corresponding almost
character,  or equivalently the fake  degree of the corresponding character
of `W` (extended by `0` outside the principal series).

One  can get  more information  on the  Lusztig Fourier  matrix of  the big
family by asking

```julia-repl

```

One  can  do  computations  with  individual  unipotent characters. Here we
construct  the Coxeter torus, and then the identity character of this torus
as a unipotent character.

```julia-repl
julia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)
G₂

julia> T=spets(reflection_subgroup(W,Int[]),W(1,2))
G₂₍₎=Φ₆

julia> u=unipotent_character(T,1)
[G₂₍₎=Φ₆]:<Id>
```

To construct `T` one could equivalently do
```julia-repl
julia> T=torus(W,position_class(W,W(1,2)))
G₂₍₎=Φ₆
```
Then  here  are  two  ways  to  construct  the  Deligne-Lusztig  character
associated to the Coxeter torus:

```julia-repl
julia> lusztig_induce(W,u)
[G₂]:<φ₁‚₀>+<φ₁‚₆>-<φ₂‚₁>+<G₂[-1]>+<G₂[ζ₃]>+<G₂[ζ₃²]>

julia> v=deligne_lusztig_character(W,[1,2])
[G₂]:<φ₁‚₀>+<φ₁‚₆>-<φ₂‚₁>+<G₂[-1]>+<G₂[ζ₃]>+<G₂[ζ₃²]>

julia> degree(v)
Pol{Int64}: q⁶+q⁵-q⁴-2q³-q²+q+1

julia> v*v
6
```

The  last two lines ask for the degree  of `v`, then for the scalar product
of `v` with itself.

Finally  we mention  that Chevie  can also  provide unipotent characters of
Spetses, as defined in [BroueMalleMichel2014](biblio.htm#BMM14). An example:

```julia-repl

`UnipotentCharacters(W)`

`W`  should be a Coxeter group, a  Coxeter Coset or a Spetses. The function
gives  back a record containing  information about the unipotent characters
of the associated algebraic group (or Spetses). This contains the following
fields:

`.harishChandra`:  information  about  Harish-Chandra  series  of  unipotent
characters.  This is itself a list of records, one for each pair `(𝐋,λ)` of
a  Levi  of  an  `F`-stable  parabolic  subgroup  and  a cuspidal unipotent
character of ``𝐋^F``. These records themselves have the following fields:

`:levi`: a list 'l' such that `𝐋` corresponds to 'ReflectionSubgroup(W,l)'.

`:cuspidalName`: the name of the unipotent cuspidal character `lambda`.

`:eigenvalue`: the eigenvalue of Frobenius for `λ`.

`:relativeType`: the reflection type of ``W_𝐆 (𝐋)``;

`:parameterExponents`:  the ``𝐆 ^F``-endomorphism  algebra of ``R_𝐋^𝐆 (λ)``
is  a  Hecke  algebra  for  ``W_𝐆  (𝐋)``  with  some parameters of the form
``q^{a_s}``. This holds the list of exponents ``a_s``.

`:charNumbers`:  the  indices  of  the  unipotent  characters indexed by the
irreducible characters of ``W_𝐆 (𝐋)``.

`.almostHarishChandra`:   information   about   Harish-Chandra   series  of
unipotent  character sheaves.  This is  identical to  ̀harishChandra` for a
split  reductive group,  and reflects  the situation  for the corresponding
split group for a nonsplit group.

`.families`:  information  about  Lusztig  families of unipotent characters.
This  is itself a list  of records, one for  each family. These records are
described in the section about families below.

the following information is computed on demand from
`uc=UnipotentCharacters(W)`:

`spets(uc)`: the reductive group `W`.

`charnames(uc)`:  the list of names of the unipotent characters.  Using
   appropriate keywords, one can control the display in various ways.

```julia-repl
julia> uc=UnipotentCharacters(coxgroup(:G,2));

julia> charnames(uc;limit=true)
10-element Vector{String}:
 "φ₁‚₀"
 "φ₁‚₆"
 "φ′₁‚₃"
 "φ″₁‚₃"
 "φ₂‚₁"
 "φ₂‚₂"
 "G₂[-1]"
 "G₂[1]"
 "G₂[ζ₃]"
 "G₂[ζ₃²]"

julia> charnames(uc;TeX=true)
10-element Vector{String}:
 "\\phi_{1,0}"
 "\\phi_{1,6}"
 "\\phi_{1,3}'"
 "\\phi_{1,3}''"
 "\\phi_{2,1}"
 "\\phi_{2,2}"
 "G_2[-1]"
 "G_2[1]"
 "G_2[\\zeta_3]"
 "G_2[\\zeta_3^2]"
```

One  can control  the display  of unipotent  characters in  various ways by
`IOContext`  properties. In the display, the row labels are the nems of the
unipotent characters. Then the following column numbers display:

    1: The index of the character in the list of unipotent characters.
    2: The degree of the unipotent character.
    3: The degree of the corresponding almost character.
    4: for classical groups, the symbol attached to the unipotent character.
    5: The eigenvalue of Frobenius attached to the unipotent character.
    6: The parameter the character has in its Lusztig family.

Which  columns  are  displayed  can  be  controlled by the property `:cols`
(default [2,3,5,6]).

In  addition if  ':byfamily=true', the  characters are  displayed family by
family  instead  of  in  index  order.  Finally,  the properties `rows` and
`columnrepartition`  of  `format`  can  be  set,  giving more tuning of the
table.

`deligne_lusztig_lefschetz(h,m=0)` or `dllefschetz(h,m=0)`

Here `h` is an element of a Hecke algebra associated to a Coxeter group `W`
or  Coxeter coset `Wϕ` which itself is  associated to an algebraic group `𝐆
`.  By [DigneMichel1985](biblio.htm#DM85),  for ``g∈  𝐆^F``, the  number of
fixed  points  of  `Fᵐ`  on  the  Deligne-Lusztig variety associated to the
element `wϕ∈Wϕ`, have for `m` divisible by a sufficently large integer `d`,
the  form ``∑_φ φ_{(qᵐ)}(T_wϕ)R_φ(g)`` where  `φ` runs over the irreducible
characters  of ``Wϕ``, where ``R_φ`` is the corresponding almost character,
and   where  ``φ_{(qᵐ)}``  is  a  character  value  of  the  Hecke  algebra
``H(Wϕ,qᵐ)``  of ``Wϕ`` with parameter `qᵐ`.  This expression is called the
*Lefschetz  character* of the Deligne-Lusztig  variety. If we consider `qᵐ`
as  an indeterminate `x`, it  can be seen as  a sum of unipotent characters
with   coefficients  character   values  of   the  generic   Hecke  algebra
``H(Wϕ,x)``.  A  more  complicated  formula  involving  the  eigenvalues of
Frobenius  attached to  unipotent characters  applies for  `m` not prime to
`d`.  The function  returns this  formula when  a second parameter `m≠0` is
given.

The  function 'dllefschetz' takes  as argument a  Hecke element and returns
the  corresponding Lefschetz character. This is defined on the whole of the
Hecke  algebra by linearity.  The Lefschetz character  of various varieties
related   to   Deligne-Lusztig   varieties,   like   their  completions  or
desingularisation,  can be  obtained by  taking the  Lefschetz character at
various elements of the Hecke algebra.

julia> dllefschetz((T(1)+T())*(T(2)+T()))
[A₂]:q<21>+(q²+2q+1)<3>
```

The   last  line  shows  the   Lefschetz  character  of  the  Samelson-Bott
desingularisation of the Coxeter element Deligne-Lusztig variety.

We now show an example with a coset (corresponding to the unitary group).

```
Finally,  there is a second form `dllefschetz(H::HeckeAlgebra,w,i=0)` where
the  arguments are a Hecke algebra and an  element of `w`. This may be used
for  Spetses where we know the column of the `CharTable` of `H` for `w` but
not other columns of the spetsial Hecke algebra charcater table.
