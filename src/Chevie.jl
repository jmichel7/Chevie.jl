"""
This is my attempt to port the Chevie package from GAP3 to Julia. I started
this  project at the end of  2018 and it is still  in flux so some function
names or interfaces may still change. Pull requests and issues are welcome.

I  have implemented the  GAP functionality (infrastructure)  needed to make
Chevie  work.  I  have  already  registered  most of this infrastructure as
separate  packages; the  following packages  are loaded  and re-exported so
that  their functionality is automatically available when you use `Chevie`.
In other words, `Chevie` is a meta-package for the following packages:

  * (univariate) [LaurentPolynomials](https://github.com/jmichel7/LaurentPolynomials.jl) (and rational fractions)
  * (multivariate) [PuiseuxPolynomials](https://github.com/jmichel7/PuiseuxPolynomials.jl) (and rational fractions when there are no fractional exponents)
  * [CyclotomicNumbers](https://github.com/jmichel7/CyclotomicNumbers.jl)(elements of cyclotomic fields)
  * [ModuleElts](https://github.com/jmichel7/ModuleElts.jl) (elements of a free module over some ring)
  * [Combinat](https://github.com/jmichel7/Combinat.jl) (combinatorics and some basic number theory)
  * [PermGroups](https://github.com/jmichel7/PermGroups.jl) (permutations, groups, permutations groups. It contains the modules `Perms` and `Groups` which could be separate packages)
  * [SignedPerms](https://github.com/jmichel7/SignedPerms.jl) (signed permutations)
  * [MatInt](https://github.com/jmichel7/MatInt.jl) (Integer matrices and lattices)
  * [CycPols](https://github.com/jmichel7/CycPols.jl) (cyclotomic polynomials)
  * [GenLinearAlgebra](https://github.com/jmichel7/GenLinearAlgebra.jl) (linear algebra on any field/ring)
  * [FinitePosets](https://github.com/jmichel7/FinitePosets.jl) (finite posets)
  * [FiniteFields](https://github.com/jmichel7/FiniteFields.jl) (finite fields)
  * [GroupPresentations](https://github.com/jmichel7/GroupPresentations.jl) (presentations of groups, and groups defined by generators and relations)
  * [UsingMerge](https://github.com/jmichel7/UsingMerge.jl) (Automatically compose several packages)

Have  a look at the  documentation of the above  packages to see how to use
their   features.  

I  have implemented  some other  infrastructure which  currently resides in
`Chevie` but may eventually become separate packages:

  * factorizing polynomials over finite fields (module `FFfac`)
  * factorizing polynomials over the rationals (module `Fact`)
  * Number fields which are subfields of the Cyclotomics (module [`Nf`](@ref))

For permutation groups I have often replaced GAP's sophisticated algorithms
with  naive  but  easy-to-write  methods  suitable  only  for  small groups
(sufficient  for the rest of  the package but perhaps  not for your needs).
Otherwise  the infrastructure code  is often competitive  with GAP, despite
using  much less code (often  100 lines of Julia  replace 1000 lines of C);
and I am sure it could be optimised better than I did. Comments on code and
design  are welcome. For functions that are too inefficient or difficult to
implement (such as character tables of arbitrary groups), `Chevie` uses the
`GAP`  package  as  an  extension.  This  means  that if you have the `GAP`
package  installed,  `Chevie`  will  automatically  call `GAP` to implement
these functions. 

Functions  in the  `Chevie.jl` package  are often  10 times faster than the
equivalent functions in GAP3/Chevie (after the maddeningly long compilation
time on the first run --- Julia's TTFP).

The  `Chevie`  package  currently  contains  about  95%  of the GAP3 Chevie
functionality.  If you  are a  user of  GAP3/Chevie, the `gap` function can
help  you to  find the  equivalent functionality  in `Chevie.jl`  to a Gap3
function:  it takes a string and  gives you Julia translations of functions
in Gap3 that match that string.

```julia-rep1
julia> gap("words")
CharRepresentationWords  =>  traces_words_mats
CoxeterWords(W[,l])      =>  word.(Ref(W),elements(W[,l]))
GarsideWords             =>  elements
```
You can then access online help for the functions you have found.

The  port to Julia is not complete in the sense that 80% of the code is the
data library from Chevie, which was automatically ported by a transpiler so
its  code is "strange".  When the need  to maintain the  `GAP3` and `Julia`
versions  simultaneously subsides,  I will  do a  proper translation of the
data library, which should give an additional speed boost.

### Installing

This is a registered package that can be installed/upgraded in the standard
way.  For Julia newbies,  we will remind  you what this  is. To install, do
this at the REPL command line:

  *  enter package mode with ]
  *  do the command
```
(@v1.10) pkg> add Chevie
```
- exit package mode with backspace and then do
```
julia> using Chevie
```
and you are set up. For first help, type "?Chevie".

To update later to the latest version, do

```
(@v1.10) pkg> update
```
`Chevie.jl` requires julia 1.10 or later.
