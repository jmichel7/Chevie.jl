Let  `R` be a  root system in  the real vector  space `V`. We say that `F₀∈
GL(V)`  is an  *automorphism of  `R`* if  it permutes  `R` and is of finite
order  (finite  order  is  automatic  if  `R` generates `V`). It follows by
[bou68;  chap.  VI,  §1.1,  lemme  1](@cite)  that  the  dual `F₀ᵛ∈ GL(Vᵛ)`
permutes  the coroots `Rᵛ⊂  Vᵛ`; thus `F₀`  normalizes the reflection group
`W` associated to `R`, that is `w↦ F₀wF₀⁻¹` is an automorphism of `W`. Thus
we get a reflection coset `WF₀`, which we call a *Coxeter coset*.

The  motivation for introducing Coxeter  cosets comes from automorphisms of
algebraic  reductive groups, giving rise to non-split reductive groups over
finite fields. Let `𝐆` be a connected reductive algebraic group `𝐆` over an
algebraic  closure `𝔽̄_q` of a finite field `𝔽_q`, defined over `𝔽_q`; this
corresponds  to a  Frobenius endomorphism  `F` so  that the finite group of
rational  points `𝐆(𝔽_q)` identifies to the  subgroup `𝐆^F` of fixed points
under `F`.

Let  `𝐓`  be  a  maximal  torus  of  `𝐆`, and let `(X(𝐓),Φ,Y(𝐓),Φᵛ)` be the
corresponding  root datum (see [`Rootdata`](@ref))  which determines `𝐆` up
to  isomorphism; this corresponds to give a root system in the vector space
`V=ℚ ⊗ X(𝐓)` and a rational reflection group `W=N_𝐆(𝐓)/𝐓` acting on it.

If  `𝐓` is `F`-stable the Frobenius endomorphism `F` acts also naturally on
`X(T)`  and defines thus  an endomorphism of  `V`, which is  of the form `q
F₀`, where `F₀∈ GL(V)` is of finite order and normalizes `W`. We get thus a
Coxeter  coset `WF₀⊂GL(V)`.  The data  `(X(𝐓), Φ,  Y(𝐓), Φᵛ,  F₀)`, and the
integer   `q`  completely  determine  up   to  isomorphism  the  associated
*reductive  finite  group*  `𝐆^F`.  Thus  these  data  hold  the  essential
information  which determines a  finite reductive group.  All properties of
Chevalley  groups that  we provide  are computed  from that  datum: symbols
representing conjugacy classes, characters, and finally the whole character
table of `𝐆^F`.

It  turns out that  many interesting objects  attached to this datum depend
only on `(V,W, F₀)`: the order of the maximal tori, the
[`fakedegrees`](@ref),  the order of  `𝐆^F`, [`symbols`](@ref) representing
unipotent characters, Deligne-Lusztig induction in terms of
[`almost_character`](@ref)s,  the  Fourier  matrix  relating characters and
almost  characters, etc… see, e.g., [bmm14](@cite).  It is thus possible to
extend  their construction to non-crystallographic  groups (or even to more
general complex reflection groups, see [`spets`](@ref)); this is why we did
not include a root system in the definition of a reflection coset. However,
unipotent conjugacy classes for instance depend on the root system.

We assume now that `𝐓` is contained in an `F`-stable Borel subgroup of `𝐆`.
This  defines an order  on the roots,  and there is  a unique element `ϕ∈ W
F₀`,  the  *reduced  element*  of  the  coset,  which  preserves the set of
positive  roots.  It  thus  defines  a  *diagram  automorphism*, that is an
automorphism  of the Coxeter system `(W,S)`.  This element is stored in the
component  `.phi` of the coset record. It may be defined without mentioning
the  roots,  as  follows:  `(W,F₀(S))`  is  another  Coxeter  system,  thus
conjugate to `S` by a unique element of `W`, thus there is a unique element
`ϕ∈  WF₀` which  stabilizes `S`;  a proof  follows from [bou68; Theoreme 1,
chap.  V, §3](@cite). We  consider thus cosets  of the form  `Wϕ` where `ϕ`
stabilizes  `S`. The coset  `W ϕ` is  completely defined by the permutation
`.phi`  when `𝐆` is semi-simple --- equivalently when `Φ` generates `V`; in
this case we just need to specify `phi` to define the coset.

There is a slight generalisation of the above setup, covering in particular
the  case of the Ree  and Suzuki groups. We  consider `𝐆^F` where `F` not a
Frobenius  endomorphism, but  an isogeny  such that  some power  `F^n` is a
Frobenius endomorphism. Then `F` still defines an endomorphism of `V` which
normalizes  `W`; we define a real number `q` such that `F^n` is attached to
an  `𝔽_{qⁿ}`-structure. Then we still have `F=q F₀` where `F₀` is of finite
order  but `q` is no more an integer.  Thus `F₀∈ GL(V⊗ ℝ)` but `F₀∉ GL(V)`.
For  instance, for the  Ree and Suzuki  groups, `F₀` is  an automorphism of
order  `2` of `W`, which is  of type `G₂`, `B₂` or  `F₄`, and `q` is an odd
power  of `√2` for `B₂` and `F₄` and an odd power of `√3` for `G₂` This can
be  constructed starting from root systems for `G₂`, `B₂` or `F₄` where all
the   roots  have   the  same   length;  these   root  systems   are  *not*
crystallographic.  We will call here *Weyl cosets* the cosets corresponding
to rational forms of algebraic groups, which include thus some non-rational
roots systems for `B₂`, `G₂` and `F₄`.

## Spets

We  now extend the above notions  to general complex reflection groups. Let
`W⊂  GL(V)` be a complex reflection group  on the vector space `V`. Let `ϕ`
be  an element  of `GL(V)`  which normalizes  `W`. Then  the coset  `Wϕ` is
called a reflection coset.

A  reference for  these cosets  is [bmm99](@cite).  When `W` is a so-called
*Spetsial*  group,  they  are  the  basic  object for the construction of a
*Spetses*,  which is an object attached  to a complex reflection group from
which  one can  derive combinatorially  some attributes  shared with finite
reductive groups, like unipotent degrees, etc….

We  say that  a reflection  coset is  irreducible if  `W` is irreducible. A
general  coset is a direct  product of *descents of  scalars*, which is the
case  where `ϕ`  is transitive  on the  irreducible components  of `W`. The
irreducible   cosets  have   been  classified   in  [bmm99](@cite):  up  to
multiplication  of  `ϕ`  by  a  scalar,  there  is  usually only one or two
possible cosets for a given irreducible group.

We  deal only  with *finite  order* cosets,  that is,  we assume there is a
(minimal) integer `δ` such that `(Wϕ)^δ=W`. Then the group generated by `W`
and `ϕ` is finite, of order `δ|W|`.

A  subset `C`  of a  `Wϕ` is  called a  *conjugacy class*  if one of the
following equivalent conditions is fulfilled:

  * `C` is the orbit of an element in `Wϕ` under the conjugation action of `W`.

  * `C` is a conjugacy class of `⟨W,ϕ⟩` contained in `Wϕ`.

  * The set `{w∈ W|wϕ∈ C}` is  a `ϕ`-conjugacy  class of `W` (two elements
`v,w∈  W` are called `ϕ`-conjugate, if and only if there exists `x∈ W` with
`v=xwϕ(x⁻¹)`).

An irreducible character of `⟨W,ϕ⟩` has some non-zero values on `Wϕ` if and
only if its restriction to `W` is irreducible. Further, two characters `χ₁`
and  `χ₂`  which  have  same  irreducible  restriction  to  `W` differ by a
character  of  the  cyclic  group  `⟨ϕ⟩`  (which identifies to the quotient
`⟨W,ϕ⟩/W`). A set containing one extension to `⟨W,ϕ⟩` of each `ϕ`-invariant
character  of `W` is called a *set  of irreducible characters* of `Wϕ`. Two
such  characters  are  orthogonal  for  the  scalar  product  on  the class
functions on `Wϕ` given by ``⟨χ,ψ⟩:=|W|¹∑_{w∈ W}χ(wϕ)\\overline{ψ(wϕ)}.``
For rational groups (Weyl groups), Lusztig has defined a choice of a set of
irreducible  characters for  `Wϕ` (called  the *preferred extensions*), but
for  more  general  reflection  cosets  we  have made some rather arbitrary
choices,  which  however  have  the  property  that their values lie in the
smallest possible field.

The  *character  table*  of  `Wϕ`  is  the  table  of  values  of  a set of
irreducible characters on the conjugacy classes.

A *subcoset* `Lwϕ` of `Wϕ` is given by a reflection subgroup `L` of `W` and
an element `w` of `W` such that `wϕ` normalizes `L`.

We  then have a natural notion of  *restriction* of class functions on `Wϕ`
to  class  functions  on  `Lwϕ`  as  well  as  of  *induction* in the other
direction.  These  maps  are  adjoint  with  respect  to the scalar product
defined above, see [bmm99](@cite).

In  this package the most general construction  of a reflection coset is by
starting  from a reflection datum, and giving in addition the matrix `F` of
the map `ϕ:V→ V` (see [`spets`](@ref)). However, at present, general cosets
are  only implemented for groups represented as permutation groups on a set
of roots, and it is required that the automorphism given preserves this set
up  to a scalar (it is allowed that  these scalars depend on the pair of an
irreducible  component and its image). It is also allowed to specify `ϕ` by
the  permutation it induces on  the roots; in this  case it is assumed that
`ϕ`  acts trivially on the orthogonal of  the roots, but the roots could be
those  of a parent  group, generating a  larger space. Thus  in any case we
have  a permutation representation of `⟨W,ϕ⟩`  and we consider the coset to
be a set of permutations.

Reflection  cosets  are  implemented  in  by  a  `struct` which points to a
reflection  group  record  and  has  additional  fields holding `F` and the
corresponding  permutation `phi`. In the general case, on each component of
`W`  which is  a descent  of scalars,  `F` will  permute the components and
differ  by a scalar on each  component from an automorphism which preserves
the  roots. In this case, we have  a permutation `phi` and a `scalar` which
is stored for that component.

The  most common situation where cosets  with non-trivial `phi` arise is as
sub-cosets  of reflection groups. Here is an "exotic" example, see the next
chapter for more classical examples involving Coxeter groups.

```julia-repl
julia> W=complex_reflection_group(14)

The  last line shows for each  reflection degree the corresponding *factor*
of  the coset, which is  the scalar by which  `ϕ` acts on the corresponding
fundamental reflection invariant. The factors characterize the coset.

A  spets by default is  printed in an abbreviated  form which describes its
type,  as above (`G₅` twisted by 2, with a Cartan matrix which differs from
the  standard one by  a factor of  `√6`). The function  `repr` gives a form
which could be input back in Julia. With the same data as above we have:

```

Conjugacy  classes and irreducible characters of Coxeter cosets are defined
as  for  general  reflection  cosets.  For  irreducible  characters of Weyl
cosets,  we choose (following Lusztig) for each `ϕ`-stable character of `W`
a  particular extension to a character of  `W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩`, which we will call the
*preferred extension*. The *character table* of the coset `Wϕ` is the table
of  the restrictions to  `Wϕ` of the  preferred extensions. The question of
finding the conjugacy classes and character table of a Coxeter coset can be
reduced to the case of irreducible root systems `R`.

  * The automorphism `ϕ` permutes the irreducible components of `W`, and
    `Wϕ`  is a direct  product of cosets  where `ϕ` permutes cyclically the
    irreducible components of `W`. The preferred extension is defined to be
    the  direct  product  of  the  preferred  extension  in  each  of these
    situations.

  * Assume now that `Wϕ` is a descent of scalars, that is the decomposition
    in irreducible components `W=W₁× ⋯ × Wₖ` is cyclically permuted by `ϕ`.
    Then there are natural bijections from the `ϕ`-conjugacy classes of `W`
    to  the `ϕᵏ`-conjugacy classes  of `W₁` as  well as from the `ϕ`-stable
    characters  of `W` to the `ϕᵏ`-stable  characters of `W₁`, which reduce
    the  definition of preferred  extensions on `Wϕ`  to the definition for
    `W₁ϕᵏ`.

  * Assume now  that `W`  is the  Coxeter group  of an  irreducible root
    system.   `ϕ`  permutes  the  simple   roots,  hence  induces  a  graph
    automorphism  on  the  corresponding  Dynkin  diagram.  If  `ϕ=1`  then
    conjugacy  classes and  characters coincide  with those  of the Coxeter
    group `W`.

The  nontrivial cases for crystallographic roots  systems are (the order of
`ϕ`  is written as left exponent to  the type): `²Aₙ`, `²Dₙ`, `³D₄`, `²E₆`.
For  non-crystallographic root  systems where  all the  roots have the same
length the additional cases `²B₂`, `²G₂`, `²F₄` and `²I₂(k)` arise.

  *   In  case  `³D₄`  the  group  `W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩`  can be embedded into the
    Coxeter  group of type `F₄`, which induces a labeling for the conjugacy
    classes of the coset. The preferred extension is chosen as the (single)
    extension with rational values.

  * In case  `²Dₙ` the  group `W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩`  is isomorphic  to a Coxeter
    group of type `Bₙ`. This induces a canonical labeling for the conjugacy
    classes  of the coset and allows to define the preferred extension in a
    combinatorial  way  using  the  labels  (pairs  of  partitions) for the
    characters of the Coxeter group of type `Bₙ`.

  *  In the remaining crystallographic cases `ϕ` identifies to `-w₀` where
    `w₀`  is the longest element of `W`.  So, there is a canonical labeling
    of  the conjugacy classes and characters of  the coset by those of `W`.
    The  preferred extensions  are defined  by describing  the signs of the
    character values on `-w₀`.

The  most general  construction of  a Coxeter  coset is  by starting from a
Coxeter   datum   specified   by   the   matrices   of   `simpleRoots`  and
`simplecoroots`,  and  giving  in  addition  the  matrix `F0Mat` of the map
`F₀:V→ V` (see the commands  `CoxeterCoset` and `CoxeterSubCoset`). As for
Coxeter  groups,  the  elements  of  `Wϕ`  are  uniquely  determined by the
permutation  they  induce  on  the  set  of  roots  `R`.  We consider these
permutations as `elements` of the Coxeter coset.

Coxeter  cosets are implemented by a struct which points to a Coxeter datum
record  and  has  additional  fields  holding `F0Mat` and the corresponding
element  `phi`. Functions on the coset (for example, `classinfo`) are about
properties  of  the  group  coset  `W  ϕ`  ;  however, most definitions for
elements of untwisted Coxeter groups apply without change to elements in `W
ϕ`:  e.g., if we define the length of  an element `wϕ∈ Wϕ` as the number of
positive  roots it sends to negative ones, it  is the same as the length of
`w`,  i.e., `ϕ` is of length `0`, since `ϕ` has been chosen to preserve the
set of positive roots. Similarly, the Coxeter `word` describing `wϕ` is the
same as the one for `w`, etc…

We associate to a Coxeter coset `Wϕ` a *twisted Dynkin diagram*, consisting
of  the Dynkin diagram of `W` and  the graph automorphism induced by `ϕ` on
this  diagram (this  specifies the  group `W⋊  ⟨F⟩`, mentioned above, up to
isomorphism).  See  the  functions  `refltype`,  `print`  and `diagram` for
Coxeter cosets.

Below  is an example showing first how to *not* define, then how to define,
the Weyl coset for a Suzuki group:

A *subcoset* `Hwϕ` of `Wϕ` is given by a reflection subgroup `H` of `W` and
an  element `w` of `W`  such that `wϕ` induces  an automorphism of the root
system of `H`. For algebraic groups, this corresponds to a rational form of
a  reductive subgroup of maximal rank.  For example, if `Wϕ` corresponds to
the  algebraic group `𝐆` and  `H` is the trivial  subgroup, the coset `Hwϕ`
corresponds to a maximal torus `𝐓_w` of type `w`.

A subgroup `H` which is a parabolic subgroup corresponds to a rational form
of  a Levi  subgroup of  `𝐆`. The  command `twistings`  gives all rational
forms of such a Levi.

Notice how we distinguish between subgroups generated by short roots and by
long  roots. A general  `H` corresponds to  a reductive subgroup of maximal
rank.  Here we consider the subgroup generated  by the long roots in `B₂`,
which  corresponds to a  subgroup of type  `SL₂× SL₂` in `SP₄`, and
show its possible rational forms.

`spets(W::ComplexReflectionGroup, F₀::Matrix=I(rank(W)))`

This  function returns a `CoxeterCoset` or a  `Spets`. Let `V` be the space
on which `W` acts. The matrix `F₀` must be in `GL(V)`, for a finite Coxeter
group  induce  an  automorphism  of  the  root  system of `parent(W)` which
stabilizes the roots of `W`, or for a more general complex reflection group
just stabilize `parent(W)` and `W`.

The returned struct has in particular the following fields:

  - `.W`: the group `W`

  - `.F`: the matrix acting on `V` which represents the unique element `phi` in `WF₀` which preserves the positive roots (for finite Coxeter groups) or some "canonical" representative of the coset for more general complex reflection groups.

  - `.phi`:  a `Perm`, the permutation of the roots of `W` induced by `.F` (for general  complex reflection groups this may be a permutation up to scalars) (also   for  Coxeter  groups   the  element  of   smallest  length  in  the `NormalCoset` `W .phi`).

In the first example we create a Coxeter coset corresponding to the general
unitary group `GU_3(q)` over the finite field `FF(q)`.
