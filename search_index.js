The integer n is called the degree of the permutation, even if it is not moved.\n\nThe  permutations in this module  follow the GAP design:  it is possible to multiply, or to store in the same group, permutations of different degrees. Slightly  faster is the MAGMA design where any permutation has to belong to a  group and the degree is determined by that group. Then multiplication of permutations  in a given group is slightly faster, but it is more difficult to multiply permutations coming from different groups, like a group and one of its subgroups.\n\nThe  permutation whose cycle decomposition is (1,2,3)(4,5) can be written Perm(1,2,3)*Perm(4,5)   or   perm\"(1,2,3)(4,5)\".   It   is  represented internally  as [2,3,1,5,4]; note that [2,3,1,5,4,6] represents the same permutation.\n\nAs  in  GAP  i^p  applies  p  to  the  integer  i,  while p^q means p^-1*q*p.\n\nThe  complete  type  of  our  permutations is Perm{T} where T<:Integer, where Vector{T} is the type of the vector which holds the image of 1:n. This   can  used  to  save  space  or  time  when  possible.  For  instance Perm{UInt8}  uses less  space than  Perm{Int} and  can be used for Weyl groups of rank <=8 since they have at most 240 roots.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> p=Perm(1,2)*Perm(2,3)\n(1,3,2)\n\njulia> Perm{Int8}(p)\nInt8(1,3,2)\n\njulia> 1^p\n3\n\njulia> Matrix(p)\n3×3 Array{Int64,2}:\n 0  0  1\n 1  0  0\n 0  1  0\n\njulia> p^Perm(3,10)\n(1,10,2)\n\njulia> inv(p)\n(1,2,3)\n\njulia> one(p)\n()\n\njulia> order(p)\n3\n\njulia> degree.((Perm(1,2),Perm(2,3)))\n(2, 3)\n\njulia> largest_moved_point(Perm(1,2)*Perm(2,3)^2)\n2\n\njulia> smallest_moved_point(Perm(2,3))\n2\n\njulia> rand(Perm,10)\n(1,8,4,2,9,7,5,10,3,6)\n\n\nOperations on permutations are *, /, inv, and mul!

It is true (but a non-trivial theorem) that in a Coxeter group the  order of st is exactly m(s,t), thus a Coxeter group is the same as a  Coxeter system, that is a pair (W,S) of a group W and a set S of involutions,  such that the group is  presented by relations describing the order  of the product of two elements of S. A Coxeter group has a natural representation, its reflection representation, on a real vector space V of  dimension length(S) (the Coxeter rank  of W), where each element of S  acts as a  reflection; the faithfulness  of this representation in the main  argument to prove  that the order  of st is  exactly m(s,t). Thus Coxeter groups are real reflection groups. The converse need not be true if the  set of reflecting  hyperplanes has bad  topological properties, but it turns out that finite Coxeter groups are the same as finite real reflection groups.  The possible Coxeter matrices for  finite Coxeter groups have been completely  classified; the corresponding finite groups play a deep role in several areas of mathematics.\n\nCoxeter  groups  have  a  nice  solution  to the word problem. The length l(w)  of an element  w∈ W is  the minimum number  of elements of S of which it is a product (since the elements of S are involutions, we do not need inverses). An expression of w of minimal length is called a reduced word  for w. The main property of  reduced words is the exchange lemma which  states that if s₁…sₖ is a  reduced word for w (thusk=l(w)) and s∈  S is such that l(sw)≤l(w) then one  of the sᵢ in the word for w can be deleted to obtain a reduced word for sw. Thus given s∈ S and w∈ W,  either l(sw)=l(w)+1 or  l(sw)=l(w)-1 and we  say in this last case that  s belongs to  the left descent  set of w.  The computation of a reduced word for an element, and other word problems, are easily done if we know  the left descent sets. For the Coxeter groups that we implement, this left  descent set  can be  easily determined  (see e.g. 'coxsym' below), so this suggests how to deal with Coxeter groups.\n\nThe type CoxeterGroup is an abstact type; an actual struct which implements it must define a function\n\nisleftdescent(W,w,i) which tells whether the       i-th element of S is in the left descending set of w.\n\nthe other functions needed in an instance of a Coxeter group are\n\ngens(W) which returns the set S (the list of Coxeter generators)\nnref(W) which  returns the  number of  reflections of  W, if  W is  finite or nothing if W is infinite\n\nIt  should be  noted that  a Coxeter group can be any kind of group implementing the above functions.\n\nA  common occurrence in code for Coxeter groups is a loop like:\n\nfindfirst(eachindex(gens(W)),x->isleftdescent(W,w,x))\n\nif you provide a function firstleftdescent(W,w) it will be called instead of the above loop.\n\nBecause  of the  easy solution  of the  word problem  in Coxeter  groups, a convenient  way  to  represent  their  elements  is as words in the Coxeter generators.  They are represented as lists of labels for the generators. By default  these labels are  given as the  index of a  generator in S, so a Coxeter  word is just  a list of  integers in 1:length(S). For reflection subgroups, the labels are indices of the reflections in the parent group.\n\nThe functions 'word' and 'W(...)' will do the conversion between Coxeter words and elements of the group.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> W=coxsym(4)\ncoxsym(4)\n\njulia> p=W(1,3,2,1,3)\nUInt8(1,4)\n\njulia> word(W,p)\n5-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 2\n 1\n\n\nWe  notice that the word we started with and the one that we ended up with, are not the same, though they represent the same element of W. The reason is  that the function 'word' computes a lexicographically smallest word for w.  Below  are  some  other  possible  computations with the same Coxeter group:\n\njulia> word(W,longest(W))  # the (unique) longest element in W\n6-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 3\n 2\n 1\n\njulia> w0=longest(W)\nUInt8(1,4)(2,3)\njulia> length(W,w0)\n6\njulia> map(i->word(W,reflection(W,i)),1:nref(W))\n6-element Array{Array{Int64,1},1}:\n [1]            \n [2]            \n [3]            \n [1, 2, 1]      \n [2, 3, 2]      \n [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\njulia> [length(elements(W,i)) for i in 0:nref(W)]\n7-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 3\n 5\n 6\n 5\n 3\n 1\n\n\nThe above line tells us that there is 1 element of length 0, there are 6 of length 3, …\n\nFor  most basic functions the convention is that the input is an element of the  group, rather than  a Coxeter word.  The reason is  that for a Coxeter group  which  is  a  permutation  group,  using the low level functions for permutations  is usually  much faster  than manipulating lists representing reduced expressions.\n\nThis  file contains mostly a port of  the basic functions on Coxeter groups in  CHEVIE.

Finite Coxeter groups  coincide with teh finite  subgroups of  GL(V) which  can be  generated y reflections. Weyl groups  are  the  finite  Coxeter  groups  which  can  be defined over the rational   numbers.  We  implement  finite   Coxter  groups  as  groups  of permutations  of  a  root  system.  Root  systems play an important role in mathematics as they classify semi-simple Lie algebras and algebraic groups.\n\nLet  us give precise definitions. Let V  be a real vector space, Vⱽ its dual  and let (,)  be the natural  pairing between Vⱽ  and V. A root system  is a finite set  of vectors R which  generate V (the roots), together  with  a  map  r↦  rⱽ  from  R  to  a subset Rⱽ of Vⱽ (the coroots) such that:\n\nFor any r∈  R, we have  (rⱽ,r)=2 so that  the formula x↦ x-(rⱽ,x)r\n\ndefines a reflection s_r:V→ V with root r and coroot rⱽ.\n\nThe reflection s_r stabilizes R.\n\nWe  will only  consider reduced  root systems,  i.e., such  that the only elements  of R colinear with r∈ R are r and -r; for Weyl groups, we also ask that the root system be crystallographic, that is (rⱽ,s) is an integer, for any s∈ R,rⱽ∈ Rⱽ.\n\nThe  subgroup W=W(R) of  GL(V) generated by  the reflections s_r is a finite  Coxeter group; when R is crystallographic, the representation V of  W  is  defined  over  the  rational  numbers.  All finite-dimensional (complex)  representations of a  finite Coxeter group  can be realized over the  same field  as V.  Weyl groups  can be  characterized amongst finite Coxeter  groups by the fact that all numbers m(s,t) in the Coxeter matrix are in {2,3,4,6}.\n\nIf  we identify  V with  Vⱽ by  choosing a  W-invariant bilinear form (.;.);  then we have rⱽ=2r/(r;r). A root system R is irreducible if it is not the union of two orthogonal subsets. If R is reducible then the corresponding  Coxeter group  is the  direct product  of the Coxeter groups associated with the irreducible components of R.\n\nThe  irreducible  crystallographic  root  systems  are  classified  by  the following  list of  Dynkin diagrams,  which, in  addition to  the Coxeter matrix,  encode also the relative length of the roots. We show the labeling of the nodes given by the function 'Diagram' described below.\n\nA_n O—O—O—…—O   B_n O⇐O—O—…—O  C_n O⇒ O—O—…—O  D_n  O 2\n    1 2 3 … n       1 2 3 … n      1  2 3 … n       ￨\n                                                  O—O—…—O\n                                                  1 3 … n\n\nG₂ O⇛ O  F₄ O—O⇒ O—O  E₆   O 2   E₇   O 2     E₈    O 2\n   1  2     1 2  3 4       ￨          ￨             ￨\n                       O—O—O—O—O  O—O—O—O—O—O   O—O—O—O—O—O—O\n                       1 3 4 5 6  1 3 4 5 6 7   1 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nThese diagrams encode the presentation of the Coxeter group W as follows: the vertices represent the generating reflections; an edge is drawn between s  and t if the order m(s,t) of st is greater than 2; the edge is single  if  m(s,t)=3,  double  if  m(s,t)=4,  triple if m(s,t)=6. The arrows  indicate the relative root lengths when W has more than one orbit on  R, as explained below; we  get the Coxeter Diagram, which describes the  underlying Weyl group, if  we ignore the arrows:  we see that the root systems B_n and C_n correspond to the same Coxeter group.\n\nHere  are  the  diagrams  for  the  finite  Coxeter  groups which  are  not crystallographic:\n\n   e        5         5\n\nI₂(e) O—O   H₃ O—O—O  H₄ O—O—O—O       1 2      1 2 3     1 2 3 4 \n\nLet us now describe how the root systems are encoded in these diagrams. Let R  be a root system in V. Then we can choose a linear form on V which vanishes  on no element of R. According to  the sign of the value of this linear  form on a root  r ∈ R we  call r positive or negative. Then there  exists a unique subset Π of  the positive roots, called the set of simple  roots, such that  any positive root  is a linear combination with non-negative  coefficients of  roots in  Π. Any  two sets of simple roots (corresponding  to  different  choices  of  linear  forms  as above) can be transformed into each other by a unique element of W(R). Hence, since the pairing  between V and Vⱽ  is W-invariant, if Π  is a set of simple roots  and if  we define  the Cartan  matrix as  being the  n times n matrix   C={rⱽ(s)}_{rs},  for  r,s∈Π  this   matrix  is  unique  up  to simultaneous  permutation of rows and columns.  It is precisely this matrix which is encoded in a Dynkin diagram, as follows.\n\nThe  indices for the rows of C label the nodes of the diagram. The edges, for  r ≠ s, are  given as follows. If  C_{rs} and C_{sr} are integers such  that |C_{rs}|≥|C_{sr}|=1  the vertices  are connected by |C_{rs}| lines,  and if |C_{rs}|>1  then we put  an additional arrow  on the lines pointing  towards the node with label s.  In other cases, we simply put a single   line  equipped  with  the  unique  integer  p_{rs}≥1  such  that C_{rs}C_{sr}=cos^2 (π/p_{sr}).\n\nConversely,  the whole root  system can be  recovered from the simple roots and  the corresponding coroots. The  reflections in W(R) corresponding to the  simple roots are called  simple reflections or Coxeter generators. They are precisely the generators for which the Coxeter diagram encodes the defining  relations of W(R). Each root is  in the orbit of a simple root, so  that R is obtained  as the orbit of  the simple roots under the group generated  by  the  simple  reflections.  The  restriction  of  the  simple reflections  to the span of R is  determined by the Cartan matrix, so R is determined by the Cartan matrix and the set of simple roots.\n\nThe  Cartan  matrix  corresponding  to  one  of  the above irreducible root systems  (with the specified labeling) is  returned by the command 'cartan' which  takes as input  a Symbol giving  the type (that  is ':A', ':B', …, ':I')  and a positive Int giving the  rank (plus an Int giving the bond for  type :I).  This function  returns a  matrix with  entries in ℤ for crystallographic  types, and a  matrix of Cyc  for the other types. Given two  Cartan matrices c1 and c2,  their matrix direct sum (corresponding to  the  orthogonal  direct  sum  of  the  root systems) can be produced by cat(c1,c2,dims=[1,2]).\n\nThe  function 'rootdatum' takes as input a  list of simple roots and a list of the corresponding coroots and produces a struct containing information about  the root system R and about W(R). If we label the positive roots by  '1:N', and the negative roots  by 'N+1:2N', then each simple reflection is  represented by the permutation of '1:2N' which it induces on the roots. If  only one argument is given, the Cartan matrix of the root system, it is taken  as the list  of coroots and  the list of  roots is assumed to be the canonical basis of V.\n\nIf one only wants to work with Cartan matrices with a labeling as specified by  the  above  list,  the  function  call  can  be  simplified. Instead of 'rootdatum(CartanMat(:D,4))' the following is also possible.\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:D,4)\nW(D₄)\n\njulia> cartan(W)\n4×4 Array{Int64,2}:\n  2   0  -1   0\n  0   2  -1   0\n -1  -1   2  -1\n  0   0  -1   2\n\nAlso,  the Weyl group struct associated to a direct sum of irreducible root systems can be obtained as a product\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,2)*coxgroup(:B,2)\nW(A₂)× W(B₂)₍₃₄₎\n\njulia> cartan(W)\n4×4 Array{Int64,2}:\n  2  -1   0   0\n -1   2   0   0\n  0   0   2  -2\n  0   0  -1   2\n\nThe  same struct  is constructed  by applying  'coxgroup' to  the matrix 'cat(cartan(:A,2), cartan(:B,2),dims=[1,2])'.\n\nThe elements of a Weyl group are permutations of the roots:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:D,4)\nW(D₄)\n\njulia> p=W(1,3,2,1,3)\nInt16(1,14,13,2)(3,17,8,18)(4,12)(5,20,6,15)(7,10,11,9)(16,24)(19,22,23,21)\n\njulia> word(W,p)\n5-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 3\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\n\nThis module is mostly a port of the basic functions on Weyl groups in CHEVIE.

Let R be a commutative ring with 1 and for s∈ S let uₛ₀,uₛ₁∈ R be elements which depend ony on the conjugacy class of s in W (this is the same  as requiring that uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ whenever mₛₜ is odd). The Iwahori-Hecke algebra of W over R with parameters uₛᵢ is a deformation of the group algebra  of W over R defined as  follows: it is the unitary associative R-algebra generated by elements Tₛ, s∈ S subject to the relations:\n\n(Tₛ-uₛ₀)(Tₛ-uₛ₁)=0 for all s∈ S (the quadratic relations)\n\nTₛTₜTₛ= TₜTₛTₜ with mₛₜ factors on each side (the braid relations)\n\nIf  uₛ₀=1 and  uₛ₁=-1 for  all s  then the quadratic relations become Tₛ²=1 and the deformation of the group algebra is trivial.\n\nSince  the generators Tₛ satisfy the  braid relations, the algebra H is in  fact a quotient of the group algebra of the braid group associated with W.  It follows that, if w=s_1⋯ s_m  is a reduced expression of w ∈ W then  the  product  Tₛ_1⋯ Tₛ_m  depends  only  on w. We will therefore denote by T_w. We have T_1=1.\n\nIf  one of uₛ₀ or uₛ₁ is invertible  in R, for example uₛ₁, then by changing  the generators  to T′ₛ=-Tₛ/uₛ₁,  and setting qₛ=-uₛ₀/uₛ₁, the braid  relations do no change  (since when mₛₜ is  odd we have uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ) but  the quadratic relations become  (T′ₛ-qₛ)(T′ₛ+1)=0. This last form is the  most common  form considered  in the  literature. Another common form, considered  in  the  context  of  Kazhdan-Lusztig  theory, is uₛ₀=√qₛ and uₛ₁=-√qₛ⁻¹.  The general form of parameters provided is a special case of general cyclotomic Hecke algebras, and can be useful in many contexts.\n\nFor  some  algebras  the  character  table,  and in general Kazhdan-Lusztig bases,  require a square root of -uₛ₀uₛ₁.  We provide a way to specify it with  the  field  .rootpara  which  can  be  given  when constructing the algebra. If not given a root is automatically extracted when needed (and we know  how to compute it) by the function RootParameter. Note however that sometimes  an  explicit  choice  of  root  is  necessary  which  cannot  be automatically determined.\n\nThere  is a universal choice  for R and uₛᵢ:  Let uₛᵢ:s∈ S,i∈[0,1] be indeterminates   such  that  uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ  whenever  mₛₜ  is  odd,  and  let A=ℤ[uₛᵢ] be the corresponding polynomial ring. Then the Hecke algebra H of  W over a  with parameters uₛᵢ  is called the generic Iwahori-Hecke algebra  of  with  W.  Any  other  algebra  with parameters vₛᵢ can be obtained  by specialization from  H: There is  a unique ring homomorphism f:A  → R such that f(uₛᵢ)=vₛᵢ  for all i. Then we  can view R as an A-module via f and we can identify the other algebra to R _A H.\n\nThe  elements {T_w∣w∈ W} actually form an  R-basis of H if one of the uₛᵢ  is invertible for all s. The  structure constants in that basis is obtained  as  follows.

If  -uₛ₀uₛ₁ has a square  root  wₛ,  we  can  scale  the  basis  Tₛ  to  get  a new basis tₛ=-Tₛ/wₛ    with   quadratic    relations   (tₛ-vₛ)(tₛ+vₛ⁻¹)=0   where vₛ=wₛ/uₛ₁.   The  most  general  case   when  Kazhdan-Lusztig  bases  and polynomials  can be defined is when the parameters vₛ belong to a totally ordered  abelian group Γ  for multiplication, see  Lus83. We set Γ⁺= {γ∈ Γ∣γ>0} and Γ⁻={γ⁻¹∣γ∈ Γ⁺}={γ∈ Γ∣γ<0}.\n\nThus  we assume ℋ defined over the ring ℤ[Γ], the group algebra of Γ over  ℤ, and the quadratic  relations of ℋ  associate to each s∈ S a vₛ∈  Γ⁺ such that  (tₛ-vₛ)(tₛ+vₛ⁻¹)=0. We also  set qₛ=vₛ² and define the  basis Tₛ=vₛtₛ with quadratic relations (Tₛ-qₛ)(Tₛ+1)=0; for w∈ W with reduced expression w=s₁…sₙ we define q_w∈ Γ⁺ by q_w^½=v_{s₁}…v_{sₙ} and let q_w=(q_w^½)².\n\nWe  define the bar involution on ℋ  by linearity: on ℤ[Γ] we define it by  overline_γ Γa_γγ= _γ Γ a_γ γ¹ and we extend it to ℋ by  overline  Tₛ=Tₛ¹.  Then  the  Kazhdan-Lusztig  basis C′_w is defined  as  the  only  basis  of  ℋ  stable  by the bar involution and congruent to t_w modulo _w WΓ t_w.\n\nThe  basis C′_w can be computed  as follows. We define elements R_xy of  ℤ[Γ] by  T_y¹=_x overlineR_xy¹  q_x¹T_x. We  then define inductively  the Kazhdan-Lusztig  polynomials (in  this general  context we should  say the  Kazhdan-Lusztig elements  of ℤ[Γ],  which belong  to the subalgebra  of ℤ[Γ] generated by  the qₛ) by P_xw=τ_(q_wq_x)^½ (_xywR_xyP_yw)  where τ  is the  truncation: τ_nu _γ Γ a_γγ= _γnua_γγ; the induction is thus on decreasing x for the Bruhat order  and  starts  at  P_ww=1.  We  have  then  C_w=_y q_w^-12 P_ywT_y.\n\nThe  Chevie code  for the  Kazhdan-Lusztig bases  C, D and their primed versions, has been initially written by Andrew Mathas around 1994, who also contributed  to  the  design  of  the programs dealing with Kazhdan-Lusztig bases. He also implemented some other bases, such as the Murphy basis which can  be  found  in  the  Chevie  contributions  directory. The code for the unequal  parameters  case  has  been  written  around  1999  by F.Digne and J.Michel. The other Kazhdan-Lusztig bases are computed in terms of the C′ basis.\n\nWhen  the ℤ[Γ] is a  Laurent polynomial ring the  bar operation is taking the  inverse of  the variables,  and truncation  is keeping terms of degree smaller or equal to that of ν. It is possible to use arbitrary groups Γ as   long   as   methods   bar:_γ   Γ   a_γγ  _γ  Γ  a_γγ¹, positive_part  : _γ  Γ a_γγ  _γ 1  a_γγ and negative_part: _γ  Γ  a_γγ    _γ  1  a_γγ  have been defined on ℤ[Γ].

The implementation  of these last monoids is in the framework of a general implementation of Garside monoids.\n\nTo   define  them  we  first  need   to  introduce  some  vocabulary  about divisibility  in monoids. A left divisor of  x is a d such that there exists  y with x=dy (and then we say  that x is a right multiple of d).  We say  that a  monoid M  is left  (resp. right) cancellable if an equality dx=dy (resp. xd=yd) implies x=y. The divisor d is proper if  y≠1. We say  that x is  an atom if  it has no proper left divisor apart from 1. A left gcd of x and y is a common left divisor d of x  and y such that  any other common left  divisor is a left divisor of d. Similarly a right lcm of x and y is a common multiple which is a left divisor of any other common multiple.\n\nWe  call Garside a monoid M which is:\n\nleft and right cancellable.\ngenerated by its atoms,  which are finite in number.\nsuch that any element has only finitely many divisors.\nadmits left and  right  gcds  and  lcms.\nadmits a Garside element, which is an element Δ whose set of left and right divisors coincide and generate M.\n\nGarside  elements are not  unique, but there  is a unique  minimal one (for divisibility); we assume such an element has been chosen. Then the divisors of  Δ are called the  simples of M. A  Garside monoid embeds into its group  of fractions, which is called a Garside group (a Garside group may have  several distinct Garside structures, as  we will see for Braid groups of finite Coxeter groups).\n\nWe  also implement locally Garside monoids,  which are monoids where lcms do  not always exist, but exist when any common multiple exists; the set of simples  is then not defined using a  Garside element, but by the condition that  they contain the atoms and are  closed under lcms and taking divisors (see  [BDM01]); since it is not ensured by the existence of Δ, one has to add  the condition that  any element is  divisible by finitely many simples (but  the number of simples can be infinite). The main example is the braid monoid of an infinite Coxeter group. It is not known if these monoids embed in  their group of fractions (though that has been proved for braid monoids of Coxeter groups by Paris [Paris01]) and thus computing in the monoid does not help for computing in the group (only the monoid is implemented here).\n\nWhat allows computing with Garside and locally Garside monoids, and Garside groups,  is the fact  that they admit  normal forms –-  these normal forms where  first exhibited for  braid monoids by  Deligne [Del72], who extended previous work of Brieskorn, Saito [BS72] and Garside [Gar69]:\n\n(i) Let  M be a locally Garside monoid and let b∈ M. Then there is a unique maximal left simple divisor α(b) of b, called the head of b –- any other simple dividing b on the left divides α(b) on the left.\n\n(ii) Assume  M is a Garside monoid, Δ is  its Garside element and G is its group  of fractions. Then,  given any element  x∈ G, there  is some power Δⁱ such that Δⁱ x∈ M.\n\nA consequence of (i) is that any element has a canonical decomposition as a product of simples, called its left-greedy normal form. If we define ω(x) by  x=α(x)ω(x), then the normal form of x is α(x)α(ω(x))α(ω^2(x))… We use  the normal form to represent elements  of M, and when M is Garside (ii)  to represent elements  of G: given  x∈ G we  compute the smallest power  i  such  that  Δⁱ  x∈  M,  and  we  represent  x by the couple (i,Δ⁻ⁱx).  We are thus reduced to the case where x∈ M, not divisible by Δ,  where we represent  x by the  sequence of simples which constitutes its normal form. We now describe Artin-Tits braid monoids. Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system, that is W has presentation\n\n⟨s∈ S∣s^2=1, sts⋯ =tst⋯   (mₛₜ factors on each side) for s,t∈ S⟩\n\nfor  some Coxeter matrix mₛₜ for s,t∈ S. The braid group B associated to (W,S) is the group defined by the presentation\n\n⟨𝐬∈ 𝐒∣ 𝐬𝐭𝐬⋯ =𝐭𝐬𝐭⋯  (mₛₜ factors on each side) for 𝐬,𝐭∈ 𝐒⟩\n\nThe positive braid monoid B⁺ associated to W is the monoid defined by the  presentation above –- it identifies to the submonoid of B generated by  𝐒 by  the result  of Paris  mentioned above.  This monoid  is locally Garside,  with set of simples  in bijection with elements  of W and atoms the elements of 𝐒; we will denote by 𝐖 the set of simples, and by 𝐰 ↦ w  the bijection between simples and elements  of W. The group W has a length  defined  in  terms  of  reduced expressions. Similarly, having only homogeneous relations, B⁺ has a natural length function. Then 𝐖 can be characterized  as the subset of the elements  of B⁺ of the same length as their image in W.\n\nIf  W is finite, then B⁺ is Garside with Garside element the element of 𝐖 whose image is the longest element  of W. A finite Coxeter group is also  a reflection group in  a real vector space,  thus in its complexified V,  and B has also a topological definition as the fundamental group of the  space Vʳᵉᵍ/W, where Vʳᵉᵍ  is the set of  elements of V which are fixed  by no  non-identity element  of S;  however, we  will not use this here.\n\nGiven a Coxeter group W,\n\nExamples\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,4)\nW(A₄)\n\njulia> B=BraidMonoid(W)\nBraidMonoid(W(A₄))\n\nconstructs  the  associated  braid  monoid,  and  then  as  a  function 'B' constructs  elements of the braid monoid (or group when W is finite) from a list of generators.\n\njulia> w=B(1,2,3,4)\n1234\n\njulia> w^3\n121321432.343\n\njulia> word(W,α(w^3))\n9-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 3\n 2\n 1\n 4\n 3\n 2\n\njulia> w^4\nδ.232432\n\njulia> inv(w)\n(1234)⁻¹\n\nAs  seen in the fourth  line above, the function  'α(b)' returns the simple α(b)∈ 𝐖 as an element of W.\n\nHow  an element of  a Garside group  is printed is  controlled by IOcontext ':greedy'.  By default, elements are printed  as fractions a⁻¹b where a and  b have no left common divisor. Each  of a and b is printed using its left-greedy normal form, that is a maximal power of the Garside element followed  the rest.  One can  print the  entire element  in the left-greedy normal  from by setting the ':greedy' IOContext; with the same w as above we have:\n\njulia> repr(w^-1,context=IOContext(stdout,:greedy=>true,:limit=>true))\n\"δ⁻¹.232432\"\n\nFinally,  repr gives   w  back   in  a   form  which   after  assigning 'B=braid(braid_monoid(W))' can be input back into Julia:\n\njulia> repr(w)\n\"B(1,2,3,4)\"\n\njulia> repr(w^3)\n\"B(1,2,1,3,2,1,4,3,2,3,4,3)\"\n\njulia> repr(w^-1)\n\"B(-4,-3,-2,-1)\"\n\nIn  general elements of  a Garside monoid  are displayed thus  as a list of their constituting atoms.\n\nWe  now describe the dual braid monoid.  For that, we first give a possible approach  to construct Garside monoids. Given a  group W and a set S of generators  of W as a monoid, we  define the length l(w) as the minimum number of elements of S needed to write w. We then define left divisors of   x  as  the  d   such  that  there  exists   y  with  x=dy  and l(d)+l(y)=l(x).  We say that w∈ W is  balanced if its set of left and right  divisors coincide,  is a  lattice (where  upper and lower bounds are lcms and gcds) and generates W. Then we have:\n\nsuppose w is balanced and let [1,w] be its set of divisors (an interval for  the partial order  defined by divisibility).  Then the monoid M with generators  [1,w] and relations  xy=z whenever xy=z  holds in W and l(x)+l(y)=l(z)  is Garside,  with simples  [1,w] and  atoms S.  It is called the interval monoid defined by the interval [1,w].\n\nThe  Artin-Tits braid monoid  is an interval  monoid by taking  for S the Coxeter generators, in which case l is the Coxeter length, and taking for w  the longest element of W. The dual monoid, constructed by Birman, Ko and  Lee  for  type  A  and  by  Bessis  for  all  well-generated complex reflection  groups, is obtained in  a similar way, by  taking this time for S  the set of all reflections, and for w a Coxeter element; then l is the  reflection length  'reflength' (for  well-generated complex reflection groups  whihc are not real S contains only those reflections which divide w  for the  reflection length);  for the  dual monoid  the simples are of cardinality  the  generalized  Catalan  numbers.  An  interval  monoid  has naturally  an inverse morphism from M  to W, called 'EltBraid' which is the  quotient map from the  interval monoid to W  which sends back simple braids to [1,w]. #A  last notable  notion is  reversible monoids.  Since in CHEVIE we store #only  left normal forms, it is easy to compute left lcms and gcds, but hard #to  compute right ones.  But this becomes  easy to do  if the monoid has an #operation  'reverse', which has the property that  'a' is a left divisor of #'b'  if and only if  'reverse(a)' is a right  divisor of 'reverse(b)'. This #holds  for Artin-Tits  and dual  braid monoids;  Artin-Tits monoids  have a #reverse  operation which consists of reversing a word, written as a list of #atoms.  The dual monoid  also has a  reverse operation defined  in the same #way,  but this operation changes  monoid: it goes from  the dual monoid for #the  Coxeter element w to the dual  monoid for the Coxeter element w⁻¹. #The  operations 'RightLcm' and  'RightGcd', as well  quite a few algorithms #have faster implementations if the monoid has a reverse operation.\n\nThis module implements functions to solve the conjugacy problem and compute centralizers  in Garside groups, following the work of Franco, Gebhardt and Gonzalez-Meneses.\n\nTwo  elements w and w' of a monoid  M are conjugate in M if there exists  x∈ M such that wx=xw'; if  M satisfies the Öre conditions, it has  a  group  of  fractions  where  this  becomes  x⁻¹wx=w',  the  usual definition  of conjugacy. A special case  which is even closer to conjugacy in  the group is if there exists y∈  M such that w=xy and w'=yx. This relation  is not transitive in general,  but we call cyclic conjugacy the transitive closure of this relation, a restricted form of conjugacy.\n\nThe  next  observation  is  that  if  w,w'  are conjugate in the group of fractions  of the Garside monoid M then  they are conjugate in M, since if  wx=xw' then  there is  a power  Δⁱ which  is central and such that xΔⁱ∈ M. Then wxΔⁱ=xΔⁱ w' is a conjugation in M.\n\nThe  crucial observation for solving the  conjugacy problem is to introduce inf(w):=sup{i such  that  Δⁱ   divides  w}  and sup(w):=inf{i such  that  w  divides Δⁱ}, and to notice  that the number of  conjugates of w with  same inf and sup as w  is finite. Further, a  theorem of Birman shows  that the maximum inf and  minimum sup in a conjugacy class can be achieved simultaneously; the elements  achieving this are called the super summit set of w. Thus a way to  determine if two elements are conjugate  is to find a representative of both  of them in  their super summit  set, and then  solve conjugacy within that  set. This can also be used  to compute the centralizer of an element: if  we consider  the super  summit set  as the  objects of a category whose morphisms are the conjugations by simple elements, the centralizer is given by the endomorphisms of the given object.\n\nWe illustrate this on an example:\n\njulia> b=B(2,1,4,1,4)\n214.14\n\njulia> c=B(1,4,1,4,3)\n14.143\n\njulia> d=representative_operation(b,c)\n(1)⁻¹21321432\n\njulia> b^d\n14.143\n\njulia> centralizer_generators(b)\n3-element Array{Gapjm.Garside.GarsideElm{Perm{Int16},BraidMonoid{Perm{Int16},Gapjm.Weyl.FCG{Int16,Int64,PRG{Int64,Int16}}}},1}:\n 21.1         \n 321432.213243\n 4\n\njulia> C=conjcat(b,:ss)\ncategory with 10 objects and 32 maps\n\njulia> C.obj\n10-element Array{Gapjm.Garside.GarsideElm{Perm{Int16},BraidMonoid{Perm{Int16},Gapjm.Weyl.FCG{Int16,Int64,PRG{Int64,Int16}}}},1}:\n 214.14\n 14.124\n 143.13\n 1214.4\n 13.134\n 124.24\n 1343.1\n 24.214\n 134.14\n 14.143\n\nThere  is a faster  solution to the  conjugacy problem given in [gebgon10]: for  each b∈ M, they define a  particular simple left divisor of b, its preferred  prefix  such  that  the  operation  sliding which cyclically conjugates  b by  its preferred  prefix, is  eventually periodic, and the period  is contained in the super summit set  of x. We say that x is in its  sliding circuit if some  iterated sliding of x  is equal to x. The set  of sliding  circuits in  a given  conjugacy class  is smaller than the super  summit  set,  thus  allows  to  solve  the conjugacy problem faster.
