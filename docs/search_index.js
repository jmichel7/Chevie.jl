I started this  project at the end of  2018 and it is still  in flux so some function names or interfaces may still change. Pull requests and issues are welcome.\n\nI  have implemented the  GAP functionality (infrastructure)  needed to make Chevie  work.  I  have  already  registered  most of this infrastructure as separate  packages; the  following packages  are loaded  and re-exported so that  their functionality is automatically available when you use Chevie. In other words, Chevie is a meta-package for the following packages:\n\n(univariate) LaurentPolynomials (and rational fractions)\n(multivariate) PuiseuxPolynomials (and rational fractions when there are no fractional exponents)\nCyclotomicNumbers(elements of cyclotomic fields)\nModuleElts (elements of a free module over some ring)\nCombinat (combinatorics and some basic number theory)\nPermGroups (permutations, groups, permutations groups. It contains the modules Perms and Groups which could be separate packages)\nSignedPerms (signed permutations)\nMatInt (Integer matrices and lattices)\nCycPols (cyclotomic polynomials)\nGenLinearAlgebra (linear algebra on any field/ring)\nFinitePosets (finite posets)\nFiniteFields (finite fields)\nGroupPresentations (presentations of groups, and groups defined by generators and relations)\nUsingMerge (Automatically compose several packages)\n\nHave  a look at the  documentation of the above  packages to see how to use their   features.  \n\nI  have implemented  some other  infrastructure which  currently resides in Chevie but may eventually become separate packages:\n\nfactorizing polynomials over finite fields (module FFfac)\nfactorizing polynomials over the rationals (module Fact)\nNumber fields which are subfields of the Cyclotomics (module Nf)\n\nFor permutation groups I have often replaced GAP's sophisticated algorithms with  naive  but  easy-to-write  methods  suitable  only  for  small groups (sufficient  for the rest of  the package but perhaps  not for your needs). Otherwise  the infrastructure code  is often competitive  with GAP, despite using  much less code (often  100 lines of Julia  replace 1000 lines of C); and I am sure it could be optimised better than I did. Comments on code and design  are welcome. For functions that are too inefficient or difficult to implement (such as character tables of arbitrary groups), Chevie uses the GAP  package  as  an  extension.  This  means  that if you have the GAP package  installed,  Chevie  will  automatically  call GAP to implement these functions. \n\nFunctions  in the  Chevie.jl package  are often  10 times faster than the equivalent functions in GAP3/Chevie (after the maddeningly long compilation time on the first run –- Julia's TTFP).\n\nThe  Chevie  package  currently  contains  about  95%  of the GAP3 Chevie functionality.  If you  are a  user of  GAP3/Chevie, the gap function can help  you to  find the  equivalent functionality  in Chevie.jl  to a Gap3 function:  it takes a string and  gives you Julia translations of functions in Gap3 that match that string.\n\njulia> gap(\"words\")\nCharRepresentationWords  =>  traces_words_mats\nCoxeterWords(W[,l])      =>  word.(Ref(W),elements(W[,l]))\nGarsideWords             =>  elements\n\nYou can then access online help for the functions you have found.\n\nThe  port to Julia is not complete in the sense that 80% of the code is the data library from Chevie, which was automatically ported by a transpiler so its  code is \"strange\".  When the need  to maintain the  GAP3 and Julia versions  simultaneously subsides,  I will  do a  proper translation of the data library, which should give an additional speed boost.\n\nInstalling\n\nThis is a registered package that can be installed/upgraded in the standard way.  For Julia newbies,  we will remind  you what this  is. To install, do this at the REPL command line:\n\nenter package mode with ]\ndo the command\n\n(@v1.10) pkg> add Chevie\n\nexit package mode with backspace and then do\n\njulia> using Chevie\n\nand you are set up. For first help, type \"?Chevie\".\n\nTo update later to the latest version, do\n\n(@v1.10) pkg> update\n\nChevie.jl requires julia 1.10 or later. \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Chevie","title":"Chevie","text":"Chevie uses its rich total infrastructure to provide extensions to several of its infrastructure packages.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Extensions-to-Laurent-and-Puiseux-polynomials","page":"Chevie","title":"Extensions to Laurent and Puiseux polynomials","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Chevie","title":"Chevie","text":"FFfac.factor(::Pol{FFE{p}}, Any) where p\nFact.factor(::Pol{T}) where T<:Union{Integer, Rational{<:Integer}}\nfactor(::Mvp{T, N}) where {T, N}","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Primes.factor-Union{Tuple{p}, Tuple{Pol{FFE{p}}, Any}} where p","page":"Chevie","title":"Primes.factor","text":"factor(f::Pol{FFE{p}}[, F])\n\nGiven  f a polynomial  over a finite  field of characteristic p, factor f,  by default over the  field of its coefficients,  or if specified over the field F.

Let 𝐓 be a maximal torus of 𝐆, let X(𝐓)  be the  character group  of 𝐓  (resp. Y(𝐓)  the dual lattice of one-parameter  subgroups  of  𝐓)  and  Φ  (resp  Φ^) the roots (resp. coroots) of 𝐆 with respect to 𝐓.\n\nThen  𝐆 is  determined up  to isomorphism  by the  root datum (X(𝐓),Φ, Y(𝐓),Φ^).  In algebraic terms, this consists  in giving a free ℤ-lattice X=X(𝐓) of dimension the rank of 𝐓 (which is also called the rank of 𝐆),  and a root system Φ ⊂ X,  and similarly giving the dual roots Φ^⊂ Y=Y(𝐓).\n\nThis  is obtained  by a  slight generalisation  of our  setup for a Coxeter group W. This time we assume that the canonical basis of the vector space V  on which W  acts is a  ℤ-basis of X,  and Φ is  specified by a matrix  simpleroots(W) whose rows are the  simple roots expressed in this basis  of X. Similarly  Φ^ is described  by a matrix simplecoroots(W) whose  rows are the simple  coroots in the basis  of Y dual to the chosen basis of X. The duality pairing between X and Y is the canonical one, that  is  the  pairing  between  vectors  x∈  X  and  y∈  Y is given by transpose(x)*y. Thus, we must have the relation simplecoroots(W)*permutedims(simpleroots(W))=cartan(W).\n\nWe  get this by using the function rootdatum, whose arguments are the two matrices simpleroots(W) and simplecoroots(W) described above. The roots need not generate V, so the matrices need not be square. For example, the root datum of the linear group of rank 3 can be obtained as:\n\njulia> W=rootdatum([-1 1 0;0 -1 1],[-1 1 0;0 -1 1])\nA₂Φ₁\n\njulia> reflrep(W,W(1))\n3×3 Matrix{Int64}:\n 0  1  0\n 1  0  0\n 0  0  1\n\nhere  the  Weyl  group  is  the  symmetric  group  on  3  letters acting by permutation of the basis of X. The dimension of X, size(simpleroots(W),2),  is the rank and  the dimension of the subspace generated   by   the   roots,   size(simpleroots(W),1),   is  called  the semi-simple rank. In the example the rank is 3 and the semisimple rank is\n\n\n\nThe  default form  W=coxgroup(:A,2) defines  the adjoint  algebraic group (the group in its isogeny class with a trivial centre). In this case Φ is a   basis  of  X,   so  simpleroots(W)  is   the  identity  matrix  and simplecoroots(W) is the Cartan matrix cartan(W) of the root system.\n\nThe   form  coxgroup(:A,2,sc=true)   constructs  the   semisimple  simply connected  algebraic  group,  where  simpleroots(W)  is the transposed of cartan(W) and simplecoroots(W) is the identity matrix.\n\nAn  extreme form of root data can  be specified more conveniently: when W is  the trivial coxgroup() (in this case 𝐆 is a torus), the root datum has  no roots, thus  is entirely determined  by the rank  r. The function torus(r)  constructs  such  a  root  datum  (it could be also obtained by giving two 0×r matrices to rootdatum).\n\nFinally,  the rootdatum function also understands some familiar names for the  algebraic groups for which it gives the results that could be obtained by giving the appropriate simpleroots(W) and simplecoroots(W) matrices:\n\njulia> rootdatum(:gl,3)   # same as the previous example\ngl₃\n\nThe types of root data which are understood are  :gl, :pgl, :sl, :slmod, :tgl :sp, :csp, :psp, :so, :pso, :cso, :halfspin,    :gpin, :spin, :E6, :E6sc, :CE6, :E7, :E7sc, :CE7, :E8, :F4, :G2.\n\nSemisimple elements\n\nWe  construct semi-simple elements in two ways. The first way is for finite order  elements of 𝐓, which over an algebraically closed field K are in bijection  with elements  of Y⊗  ℚ /ℤ  whose denominator  is prime to the characteristic of K. These are represented as a vector of Rationals r such  that 0≤r<1. The function ss  constructs such a semisimple element from a vector of Rationals.\n\nMore generally a torus 𝐓 over a field K is isomorphic to (Kˣ)^n where n  is the dimension  of 𝐓, so  a vector of  elements of Kˣ  is a more general representation which is produced by the function SemisimpleElement;  in  this  setting  the  result  of  ss is naturally interpreted  as a  Vector{Root1}, so  it can  also be obtained by calling SemisimpleElement which such a vector.\n\njulia> G=rootdatum(:sl,4)\nsl₄\n\njulia> ss(G,[1//3,1//4,3//4,2//3])\nSemisimpleElement{Root1}: <ζ₃,ζ₄,ζ₄³,ζ₃²>\n\njulia> SemisimpleElement(G,[E(3),E(4),E(4,3),E(3,2)])\nSemisimpleElement{Root1}: <ζ₃,ζ₄,ζ₄³,ζ₃²>\n\njulia> L=reflection_subgroup(G,[1,3])\nA₃₍₁₃₎=A₁×A₁Φ₁\n\njulia> C=algebraic_center(L)\n(Z0 = SubTorus(A₃₍₁₃₎=A₁×A₁Φ₁,[1 2 1]), AZ = Group(SemisimpleElement{Root1}[<1,1,-1>]), descAZ = [[1, 2]], ZD = Group(SemisimpleElement{Root1}[<-1,1,1>, <1,1,-1>]))\n\njulia> T=torsion_subgroup(C.Z0,3)\nGroup(SemisimpleElement{Root1}[<ζ₃,ζ₃²,ζ₃>])\n\njulia> e=sort(elements(T))\n3-element Vector{SemisimpleElement{Root1}}:\n <1,1,1>\n <ζ₃,ζ₃²,ζ₃>\n <ζ₃²,ζ₃,ζ₃²>\n\nIn  the above, the Levi subgroup  L of SL₄ consisting of block-diagonal matrices  of shape  2×2 is  constructed.

The unipotent  classes depend on the characteristic of k; their classification differs when the characteristic is  not good  (that is,  when it  divides one  of the coefficients of the highest  root).  In  good  characteristic,  the  unipotent  classes  are in bijection with nilpotent orbits on the Lie algebra.\n\nWe  give  the  following  information  for  a unipotent element u of each class:\n\nthe centralizer C_𝐆 (u), that we describe by the reductive part of C_𝐆  (u)^0, by the  group of components  A(u)=C_𝐆 (u)C_𝐆 (u)^0, and by the dimension of its radical.\nin good characteristic, the  Dynkin-Richardson  diagram.\nthe Springer correspondence,  attaching characters of  the Weyl group or relative Weyl groups to each character of A(u).\n\nThe  Dynkin-Richarson diagram is  attached to a  nilpotent element e of the  Lie algebra  𝔤. By  the Jacobson-Morozov  theorem there  exists an 𝔰𝔩₂ subalgebra of 𝔤 containing e as the element beginpmatrix0100  endpmatrix.  Let  𝐒  be  the  torus beginpmatrixh00h^-1 endpmatrix of SL₂ and let 𝐓 be  a  maximal  torus  containing  𝐒,  so  that 𝐒 is the image of a one-parameter   subgroup  σ  Y(𝐓).  Consider  the  root  decomposition 𝔤=_αΦ𝔤_α  given by 𝐓 and the  root system Φ; then ασα defines  a linear form  on Φ, determined  by its value  on simple roots Π.  It is possible to choose a  system of simple roots such that σα 0  for αΠ,  and then  σα012 for  any αΠ. The Dynkin diagram  of  Π  decorated  by  these  values  012  is  called the Dynkin-Richardson  diagram  of  e,  and  in  good  characteristic  is a complete invariant of its 𝔤-orbit.\n\nAnother  classification of unipotent  elements was given  by Bala-Carter. A standard  parabolic subgroup 𝐏 of 𝐆  parameterised by a subset I⊂Π is distinguished  if the linear form σ taking the value 2 for α∈ I and 0 for other simple roots satisfies 2n₀+semisimplerank(𝐆)=n₂, where nᵢ is  the number  of roots  in Φ  where σ  takes the  value i.  Given a distinguished  parabolic 𝐏,  there is  a unique  unipotent class which is dense  in the  unipotent radical  of 𝐏.  This class  has the  linear form described  by the  Dynkin-Richardson diagram  equal to  σ. Such unipotent classes  are called distinguished.  The theorem of  Bala-Carter says that every  unipotent class is  distinguished in the  smallest Levi subgroup 𝐋 which  contains  it,  and  that  such  pairs  of  𝐋 and the distinguished parabolic  𝐏  of  𝐋  taken  up  to  𝐆-conjugacy are in bijection with unipotent classes of 𝐆.\n\nLet  ℬ be  the variety  of all  Borel subgroups  and let  ℬᵤ be the subvariety  of Borel subgroups  containing the unipotent  element u. Then dim C_𝐆(u)=rank 𝐆 + 2 dim ℬ_u and in good characteristic this dimension can  be computed from  the Dynkin-Richardson diagram:  the dimension of the class of u is the number of roots α such that σα01.\n\nWe   now  describe  the  Springer  correspondence.  Indecomposable  locally constant  𝐆-equivariant  sheaves  on  a  unipotent  class C, called local  systems, are  parameterised by  irreducible characters of A(u) for  u∈ C. The ordinary Springer  correspondence is a bijection between irreducible  characters of the Weyl  group and a large  subset of the local systems  containing all trivial  local systems (those  parameterised by the trivial  character  of  A(u)  for  each  u).  More  generally,  the generalised  Springer correspondence  associates to  each local  system a (unique  up to 𝐆-conjugacy) cuspidal pair of a Levi subgroup 𝐋 of 𝐆  and a cuspidal local  system on an unipotent  class of 𝐋, such that  the  set  of  local  systems  associated  to a given cuspidal pair is parameterised  by the characters of the  relative Weyl group W_𝐆 (𝐋)=N_𝐆 (𝐋)𝐋.  There are only few cuspidal pairs  (at most one in each dimension for classical groups).\n\nThe  Springer correspondence gives information on the character values of a finite  reductive groups  as follows:  assume that  k is  the algebraic closure  of a finite field 𝔽_q and that F is the Frobenius attached to  an 𝔽_q-structure of  𝐆. Let C  be an F-stable unipotent class  and let u C^F; we call C the geometric class of u and the 𝐆^F-classes inside C^F are parameterised by the F-conjugacy classes  of A(u), denoted H¹(FA(u)) (most  of the time we can find u such that F acts trivially on A(u) and H¹(FA(u)) is then just the conjugacy classes). To an F-stable character φ of A(u) we  associate  the  characteristic  function  of  the corresponding local system (actually associated to an extension φ of φ to A(u)F); it  is a class function  Y_uφ on 𝐆^F which  can be normalized so that:  Y_uφ(u₁)=φ(cF) if u₁ is geometrically conjugate to u and  its 𝐆^F-class is parameterised by the F-conjugacy class cF of  A(u), otherwise Y_uφ(u₁)=0. If  the pair uφ corresponds via  the Springer correspondence to the character χ of W_𝐆(𝐋), then Y_uφ  is also  denoted Yᵪ.  There is  another important class of functions  indexed by local  systems: to a  local system on  class C is attached  an intersection cohomology complex, which is a complex of sheaves supported on the closure C. To such a complex of sheaves is associated its  characteristic  function,  a  class  function of 𝐆^F obtained by taking  the alternating trace of the Frobenius  acting on the stalks of the cohomology  sheaves. If Y_ψ  is the characteristic  function of a local system,  the  characteristic  function  of  the  corresponding intersection cohomology  complex is  denoted by  X_ψ. This  function is supported on C,  and Lusztig has shown that X_ψ=ᵩ P_ψχ Yᵪ where P_ψχ are  integer polynomials in q and  Yᵪ are attached to local systems on classes lying in C.\n\nLusztig   and  Shoji  have  given  an   algorithm  to  compute  the  matrix P_ψχ,  which is implemented in Chevie. The relation to characters of 𝐆(𝔽_q),    considering   for    simplicity   the    ordinary   Springer correspondence,  is that the  restriction to the  unipotent elements of the almost  character R_χ is equal to  q^bᵪ Xᵪ, where bᵪ is dim ℬᵤ  for an element u of  the class C such that  the support of χ is C.  The restrictions of the Deligne-Lusztig characters R_w for w∈ W  on the  unipotents are  called the  Green functions  and can  also be computed  by Chevie.  The values  of all  unipotent characters on unipotent elements  can also be  computed in principle  by applying Lusztig's Fourier transform  matrix (see the  section on the  Fourier matrix) but  there is a difficulty  in that the  Xᵪ must first  be multiplied by  some roots of unity  which are not known  in all cases (and  when known may depend on the congruence class of q modulo some small primes).\n\nFinally,  we describe  how unipotent  classes of  𝐆 are  parameterised in various   quasisimple  groups.   In  classical   types,  the   classes  are parametrised by partitions corresponding to the Jordan form in the standard representation. Thus,\n\nfor Aₙ we have partitions of n+1.\nfor  B_n we have partitions of 2n+1  where even parts occur an even number  of times. In characteristic  2, types B and  C are isogenous so have the same classification; thus see the next paragraph.\nfor  C_n we  have partitions  of 2n  where odd  parts occur an even number  of times. In characteristic 2,  there are 2ᵏ classes attached to  a partition where  k is the  number of even  parts which occur an even number of times.\nfor  D_n we have partitions of 2n  where even parts occur an even number  of times,  excepted there  are two  classes when  all parts are even.  In characteristic 2, we have  partitions of 2n where odd parts occur  an  even  number  of  times,  excepted  there are 2ᵏ+δ classes attached  to a partition  where k is  the number of  even parts which occur an even number of times, and δ is 2 when all parts are even and 0 otherwise.\n\nIn  exceptional  groups,  the  names  of  the  classes are derived from the Bala-Carter classification. The name for a class parametrised by (𝐋,𝐏) is of  the form l(p)  where l is  the name of  𝐋 and (p) is present if there  is more than one distinguished  parabolic in 𝐋 and describes which one  it  is.  Before  the  classification  of  Bala-Carter  was universally adopted,  Shoji and Mizuno used a  different scheme where sometimes a class was  parametrised by a reductive  subgroup of maximal rank  which was not a Levi.  These  older  labels  can  be  obtained  instead  by giving the IO property  :shoji=>true or  :mizuno=>true. In  a bad characteristic p, there  are extra classes. Each of them is associated to a class c in good characteristic and is named (c)ₚ.\n\nWe illustrate the above descriptions on some examples:\n\njulia> UnipotentClasses(rootdatum(:sl,4))\nUnipotentClasses(sl₄)\n1111<211<22<31<4\n┌────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│u   │D-R dℬ ᵤ B-C   C_𝐆(u) A₃(Φ₁³) A₁(A₁×A₁Φ₁)/-1 .(A₃)/ζ₄ .(A₃)/ζ₄³│\n├────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│4   │222    0 222    q³.Z₄     1:4           -1:2    ζ₄:Id    ζ₄³:Id│\n│31  │202    1 22.    q⁴.Φ₁   Id:31                                  │\n│22  │020    2 2.2 q⁴.A₁.Z₂    2:22          11:11                   │\n│211 │101    3 2..  q⁵.A₁Φ₁  Id:211                                  │\n│1111│000    6 ...

The  partial  order on unipotent classes  given by  Zariski closure  is given  before the  table. The column D-R,   which   is   only   shown   in   good  characteristic,  gives  the Dynkin-Richardson  diagram  for  each  class;  the  column  dBu gives the dimension  of the variety  ℬ ᵤ. The  column B-C gives the Bala-Carter classification of u, that is in the case of sl₄ it shows u as a regular  unipotent  in  a  Levi  subgroup  by  giving the Dynkin-Richardson diagram  of a regular unipotent (all  2's) for the entries corresponding to the  Levi and . for the entries  which not corresponding to the Levi. The column C(u) describes the group C_𝐆(u): a power qᵈ describes that the  unipotent  radical  of  C_𝐆(u)  has  dimension  d (thus qᵈ rational  points); then follows a description  of the reductive part of the neutral  component of C_𝐆(u), given by the name of its root datum. Then if  C_𝐆(u) is not connected, the description of A(u) is given using a  different vocabulary: a cyclic group of order  4 is given as Z4, and a symmetric group on 3 points would be given as S3.\n\nFor  instance, the first class 4  has C_𝐆(u)^0 unipotent of dimension 3 and A(u) equal to Z4, the cyclic group of order 4. The class 22 has  C_G(u) with unipotent radical of  dimension 4, reductive part of type  A1 and A(u) is  Z2, that is the  cyclic group of order 2. The other  classes have C_𝐆(u) connected. For  the class 31 the reductive part of C_G(u) is a torus of rank 1.\n\nThen  there is one column for each Springer series, giving for each class the  pairs  'a:b'  where  'a'  is  the  name  of  the character of A(u) describing  the local system involved and 'b'  is the name of the character of  the (relative) Weyl group corresponding by the Springer correspondence.

The  data for  a quasi-simple  simply connected group 𝔾 have been entered by hand for each type. In such a group to each Springer series is  attached a character of A(Z), the  group of components of the center. For  any reductive group 𝔾'  of the same type  with center Z' the group A(Z') is a quotient of the group A(Z). The Springer series for 𝔾' are those  such  that  the  corresponding  character  of A(Z) factors through A(Z')   (for  computing  A(Z')   see  algebraic_center).  The geometric  unipotent classes of  𝔾 and 𝔾'  are in bijection.  For u a unipotent  element  of  𝔾'  (which  we  can  consider also as a unipotent element  of 𝔾) the group  A₁=A(u) in 𝔾' is  a quotient of A=A(u) in 𝔾  that we can  compute as follows:  the Springer correspondence for 𝔾' tells us which characters of A survive in 𝔾'. Then A' is the quotient of A by the common kernel of these characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"ucl.html#Chevie.Ucl.UnipotentClasses","page":"Unipotent classes of reductive groups","title":"Chevie.Ucl.UnipotentClasses","text":"UnipotentClasses(W[,p])\n\nW  should  be  a  CoxeterGroup  record  for a Weyl group or RootDatum describing a reductive algebraic group 𝐆.

The list is sorted by increasing  piece dimension, while each piece is sorted by decreasing class dimension, so the special class is listed first.\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)\nG₂\n\njulia> special_pieces(UnipotentClasses(W))\n3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:\n [1]\n [4, 3, 2]\n [5]\n\njulia> special_pieces(UnipotentClasses(W,3))\n3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:\n [1]\n [4, 3, 2, 6]\n [5]\n\nThe   example  above  shows  that  the  special  pieces  are  different  in characteristic 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"ucl.html#Chevie.Ucl.distinguished_parabolics","page":"Unipotent classes of reductive groups","title":"Chevie.Ucl.distinguished_parabolics","text":"distinguished_parabolics(W)\n\nthe  list  of  distinguished  parabolic  subgroups  of  W in the sense of Richardson,  each  given  as  the  list  of  the corresponding indices.

For each irreducible  group the character  table is either  computed using recursive formulas  for the infinite series,  or read into the  system from a library file  for the  exceptional types.  Thus, character  tables can  be obtained quickly  even for very large groups  (e.g., E₈). Similar remarks apply for conjugacy classes.\n\nThe  conjugacy  classes  and  irreducible  characters of irreducible finite complex reflection groups have canonical labelings by certain combinatorial objects;  these labelings are used in the  tables we give. For the classes, these  are partitions or partition tuples  for the infinite series, or, for exceptional  Coxeter  groups,  Carter's  admissible  diagrams Carter1972; for other  primitive  complex  reflection  groups  we  just  use  words  in the generators  to specify  the classes.  For the  characters, these  are again partitions  or partition tuples for the infinite series, and for the others they  are pairs  of two  integers (d,e)  where d  is the  degree of the character  and  e  is  the  smallest  symmetric  power  of the reflection representation  containing  the  given  character  as  a  constituent  (the b-invariant of the character). This information is given by the functions classinfo  and  charinfo.  When  you  display  the character table, the canonical labelings for classes and characters are displayed.\n\nA  typical example  is coxgroup(:A,n),  the symmetric  group 𝔖ₙ₊₁ where classes  and characters are  parameterized by partitions  of n+1 (this is also the case for coxsym(n+1)).\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,3)\nA₃\n\njulia> CharTable(W)\nCharTable(A₃)\n┌────┬─────────────────┐\n│    │1111 211 22 31  4│\n├────┼─────────────────┤\n│1111│   1  -1  1  1 -1│\n│211 │   3  -1 -1  .  1│\n│22  │   2   .  2 -1  .│\n│31  │   3   1 -1  . -1│\n│4   │   1   1  1  1  1│\n└────┴─────────────────┘\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)\nG₂\n\njulia> ct=CharTable(W)\nCharTable(G₂)\n┌─────┬────────────────────┐\n│     │A₀ Ã₁ A₁ G₂ A₂ A₁+Ã₁│\n├─────┼────────────────────┤\n│φ₁‚₀ │ 1  1  1  1  1     1│\n│φ₁‚₆ │ 1 -1 -1  1  1     1│\n│φ′₁‚₃│ 1  1 -1 -1  1    -1│\n│φ″₁‚₃│ 1 -1  1 -1  1    -1│\n│φ₂‚₁ │ 2  .  .  1 -1    -2│\n│φ₂‚₂ │ 2  .  . -1 -1     2│\n└─────┴────────────────────┘\n\njulia> ct.charnames\n6-element Vector{String}:\n \"\\phi_{1,0}\"\n \"\\phi_{1,6}\"\n \"\\phi_{1,3}'\"\n \"\\phi_{1,3}''\"\n \"\\phi_{2,1}\"\n \"\\phi_{2,2}\"\n\njulia> ct.classnames\n6-element Vector{String}:\n \"A_0\"\n \"\\tilde A_1\"\n \"A_1\"\n \"G_2\"\n \"A_2\"\n \"A_1+\\tilde A_1\"\n\nReflection  groups  have  fake  degrees  (see fakedegrees), whose valuation and degree give two integers b,B for each irreducible character of  W. For  spetsial groups  (which include  finite Coxeter  groups), the valuation  and degree of the generic degrees  of the Hecke algebra give two more integers a,A (for Coxeter groups see Carter1985, Ch.11 for more details). These integers are also used in the  operations of  truncated induction,  see j_induction_table and J_induction_table.\n\nIwahori-Hecke  algebras and  cyclotomic Hecke  algebras also have character tables, see the corresponding chapters.\n\nWe  now describe for each type our conventions for labeling the classes and characters.\n\nType  Aₙ  (n≥0).  In  this  case  we  have  W ≅ 𝔖ₙ₊₁. The classes and characters  are labelled by partitions of  n+1. The partition labelling a class  is the cycle type of the  elements in that class; the representative in  '.classtext' is  the concatenation  of the  words corresponding to each part,  where the word for a part  i is  the  product of i-1 consecutive generators  (starting  one  higher  than  the  last  generator used for the previous  parts). The partition labelling a character describes the type of the  Young  subgroup  such  that  the  trivial  character induced from this subgroup  contains that character with multiplicity 1 and such that every other character occurring in this induced character has a higher a-value. Thus,  the sign  character is  labelled by  the partition  (1ⁿ⁺¹) and the trivial character by the partition (n+1). The character of the reflection representation of W is labelled by (n,1).\n\nType  Bₙ  (n≥2).  In  this  case  W=W(Bₙ) is isomorphic to the wreath product  of the cyclic  group of order  2 with the  symmetric group 𝔖ₙ. Hence  the classes and characters are  parameterized by pairs of partitions such  that the total sum of their  parts equals n. The pair corresponding to  a class describes the signed cycle type for the elements in that class, as in Carter1972. We use the convention that if (λ,μ) is such a pair then λ corresponds to the positive and μ to the negative cycles.  Thus, (1ⁿ,-) and  (-,1ⁿ) label respectively  the trivial class and  the  class  of  the  longest  element.\n\nThe  pair  corresponding  to  an  irreducible  character  is determined via Clifford  theory, as  follows. We  have a  semidirect product decomposition W(Bₙ)=N  ⋊  𝔖ₙ  where  N  is  the standard n-dimensional 𝔽₂ⁿ-vector space.  For a,b ≥ 0 such that  n=a+b let η_ab be the irreducible character  of N  which takes  value 1  on the  first a standard basis vectors  and value -1 on the last b standard basis vectors of N. Then the  inertia subgroup of η_ab has the form T_ab=N(𝔖_a  𝔖_b) and  we  can  extend  η_ab  trivially  to  an  irreducible character η_ab  of T_ab. Let α and β be partitions of a and b, respectively.  We take the tensor  product of the corresponding irreducible characters  of 𝔖_a and 𝔖_b and  regard this as an irreducible character of  T_ab. Multiplying this character  with η_ab and inducing to  W(Bₙ) yields  an irreducible  character χ=  χ_(αβ) of W(Bₙ). This defines the correspondence between irreducible characters and pairs of partitions as above.\n\nFor example, the pair ((n),-) labels the trivial character and (-,(1ⁿ)) labels  the  sign  character.  The  character  of  the  natural  reflection representation is labeled by ((n-1),(1)).\n\nType  Dₙ (n≥4). In this case W=W(Dₙ) can be embedded as a subgroup of index  2 into the Coxeter  group W(Bₙ). The intersection  of a class of W(Bₙ) with W(Dₙ) is either empty or a single class in W(Dₙ) or splits up  into two classes in  W(Dₙ). This also leads  to a parameterization of the  classes of W(Dₙ) by pairs of  partitions (λ,μ) as before but where the  number of parts of μ is even and where there are two classes of this type  if μ is empty and all parts of  λ are even. In the latter case we denote  the two classes in W(Dₙ) by (λ,+) and (λ,-), where we use the convention  that  the  class  labeled  by (λ,+) contains a representative which  can be written  as a word  in {s₁,s₃,…,sₙ} and  (λ,-) contains a representative which can be written as a word in {s₂,s₃, …,sₙ}.\n\nBy  Clifford theory the restriction of  an irreducible character of W(Bₙ) to  W(Dₙ)  is  either  irreducible  or  splits  up  into  two irreducible components.  Let (α,β) be  a pair of  partitions with total  sum of parts equal to n. If α!=β then the restrictions of the irreducible characters of  W(Bₙ) labeled  by (α,β)  and (β,α)  are irreducible and equal. If α=β  then the restriction of the character labeled by (α,α) splits into two  irreducible components  which we  denote by  (α,+) and (α,-). Note that  this can only happen if n is  even. In order to fix the notation we use  a  result  of  Stembridge1989  which describes the value  of the  difference of  these two  characters on  a class of the form (λ,+)  in terms of the character values of the symmetric group 𝔖_{n/2}. Recall  that it is implicit  in the notation (λ,+)  that all parts of λ are even. Let λ' be the partition of n/2 obtained by dividing each part by  2. Then the value of χ_{(α,-)}-χ_{(α,+)} on an element in the class (λ,+) is given by 2^{k(λ)} times the value of the irreducible character of  𝔖_{n/2} labeled by α on the class of cycle type λ'. (Here, k(λ) denotes the number of non-zero parts of λ.)\n\nThe  labels for the trivial, the  sign and the natural reflection character are the same as for W(Bₙ), since these characters are restrictions of the corresponding characters of W(Bₙ).\n\nThe groups G(d,1,n). They  are isomorphic to the wreath product of the cyclic group of order d with  the  symmetric  group  𝔖ₙ.  Hence  the  classes  and characters are parameterized  by d-tuples of partitions such that the total sum of their parts  equals n. The words chosen  as representatives of the classes are, when d>2, computed in a slightly different way than for Bₙ, in order to agree  with the words on which Ram  and Halverson compute the characters of the  Hecke algebra. First the parts of the d partitions are merged in one big  partition and sorted in  increasing order. Then, to  a part i coming from  the j-th partition is  associated the word (l+1…1… l+1)ʲ⁻¹l+2…l+i where l is the highest generator used to express the previous part.\n\nThe  d-tuple corresponding to an  irreducible character is determined via Clifford  theory in  a similar  way than  for the  Bₙ case.  The identity character  has the first  partition with one  part equal n  and the other ones  empty. The character of the  reflection representations has the first two  partitions with one part  equal respectively to n-1  and to 1, and the other partitions empty.\n\nThe groups G(de,e,n). They  are normal  subgroups of  index e  in G(de,1,n).  The quotient is cyclic,  generated by the image g  of the first generator of G(de,1,n). The  classes are parameterized as the  classes of G(de,e,n) with an extra information for a component of a class which splits.\n\nAccording  to  Hugues1985,  a  class  C of G(de,1,n) parameterized  by a de-partition (S₀S_de-1) is in G(de,e,n) if e  divides ᵢ i _p Sᵢp. It  splits in d classes for the largest d  dividing e and all parts of all  Sᵢ and such that Sᵢ is empty if d  does not divide i. If w is in C then 'gⁱ w g⁻ⁱ' for 'i in 0:d-1' are  representatives of the classes of G(de,e,n) which meet C. They are described by appending the integer i to the label for C.\n\nThe  characters are described by Clifford theory. We make g act on labels for  characters of G(de,1,n)  . The action  of g permutes circularly by d  the partitions in the de-tuple.  A character has same restriction to G(de,e,n)  as its transform by g.  The number of irreducible components of its restriction is equal to the order k of its stabilizer under powers of  g.  We  encode  a  character  of  G(de,e,n)  by first, choosing the smallest  for lexicographical order label  of a character whose restriction contains  it; then this label is periodic with a motive repeated k times; we  represent the  character by  one of  these motives,  to which we append E(k)ⁱ for 'i in 0:k-1' to describe which component of the restriction we choose.\n\nTypes G₂ and F₄. The matrices of character values and the orderings and labelings  of  the  irreducible  characters  are  exactly  the  same  as in Carter1985,  p.412/413:  in  type  G₂  the  character φ₁,₃'  takes the value -1 on the reflection associated to the long simple root;  in type F₄, the characters φ₁,₁₂', φ₂,₄', φ₄,₇', φ₈,₉' and φ₉,₆' occur in the induced of the identity from the A₂ corresponding to the  short  simple  roots;  the  pairs  (φ₂,₁₆',  φ₂,₄″)  and (φ₈,₃', φ₈,₉″)  are  related  by  tensoring  by  sign; and finally φ₆,₆″ is the exterior  square of the  reflection representation. Note,  however, that we put  the long root at  the left of the  Dynkin diagrams to be in accordance with the conventions in Lusztig1985, (4.8) and (4.10).\n\nThe classes are labeled by Carter's admissible diagrams Carter1972.  A character  is labeled  by a pair (d,b) where  d denotes the  degree and b  the corresponding b-invariant. If there  are several characters with the same  pair (d,b) we attach a prime to them, as in Carter1985.\n\nTypes  E₆,E₇,E₈. The character  tables are obtained  by specialization of those  of the Hecke algebra. The classes are labeled by Carter's admissible diagrams Carter1972. A character is labeled by the pair (d,b)  where  d  denotes  the  degree  and  b  is  the  corresponding b-invariant.  For  these  types,  this  gives  a  unique  labeling of the characters.\n\nNon-crystallographic  types I₂(m), H₃, H₄. In these cases we do not have  canonical  labelings  for  the  classes.  We  label  them  by reduced expressions.\n\nEach  character for  type H₃  is uniquely  determined by the pair (d,b) where  d is the degree and  b the corresponding b-invariant. For type H₄  there are just  two characters (those  of degree 30)  for which the corresponding  pairs are  the same.  These two  characters are nevertheless distinguished  by  their  fake  degrees:  the  character φ₃₀,₁₀' has fake degree  q¹⁰+q¹²+ higher terms, while φ₃₀,₁₀″ has fake degree q¹⁰+q¹⁴+ higher  terms. The characters in the table for type H₄ are ordered in the same way as in Alvis and Lusztig1982.\n\nFinally,  the characters  of degree 2  for type  I₂(m) are  ordered as follows.  The matrix representations affording the characters of degree 2 are given by: ρ_j  s₁s₂  beginpmatrixzeta_m^j00zeta_m^-jendpmatrix  s₁beginpmatrix0110endpmatrix where  1 ≤ j ≤  ⌊(m-1)/2⌋. The reflection representation is  ρ₁. The  characters in  the table  are ordered by listing first the characters of degree 1 and then ρ₁,ρ₂,….\n\nPrimitive complex reflection groups G₄ to G₃₄. The  groups G₂₃=H₃, G₂₈=F₄, G₃₀=H₄ are exceptional Coxeter groups and have  been  explained  above.  Similarly  for  the  other groups labels for characters  consist primarily  of the  pair (d,b)  where d  denotes the degree  and b is the corresponding  b-invariant. This is sufficient for G₄,  G₁₂, G₂₂ and G₂₄. For other  groups there are pairs or triples of  characters which  have the  same (d,b)  value. We  disambiguate these according  to  the  conventions  of Malle2000 for G₂₇, G₂₉, G₃₁, G₃₃ and G₃₄:\n\nFor G₂₇:\n\nThe  fake degree  of φ₃,₅'  (resp. φ₃,₂₀',  φ₈,₉″) has smaller degree that  of  φ₃,₅″  (resp.  φ₃,₂₀″,  φ₈,₉'). The characters φ₅,₁₅' and φ₅,₆' occur with multiplicity 1 in the induced from the trivial character of  the parabolic subgroup  of type A₂  generated by the  first and third generator  (it is asserted mistakenly in Malle2000 that φ₅,₆″ does not occur in this induced; it occurs with multiplicity 2).\n\nFor G₂₉:\n\nThe  character  φ₆,₁₀‴  is  the  exterior  square  of φ₄,₁; its complex conjugate  is φ₆,₁₀⁗. The  character φ₁₅,₄″ occurs  in φ₄,₁⊗φ₄,₃; the character  φ₁₅,₁₂″  is  tensored  by  the  sign  character from φ₁₅,₄″. Finally  φ₆,₁₀' occurs in  the induced from  the trivial character of the standard parabolic subgroup of type A₃ generated by the first, second and fourth generators.\n\nFor G₃₁:\n\nThe  characters φ₁₅,₈', φ₁₅,₂₀' and φ₄₅,₈″ occur in φ₄,₁⊗φ₂₀,₇; the character   φ₂₀,₁₃'  is  complex  conjugate  of  φ₂₀,₇;  the  character φ₄₅,₁₂'  is tensored by sign of φ₄₅,₈'. The two terms of maximal degree of  the fakedegree of φ₃₀,₁₀' are  q⁵⁰+q⁴⁶ while for φ₃₀,₁₀″ they are q⁵⁰+2q⁴⁶.\n\nFor G₃₃:\n\nThe two terms of maximal degree of the fakedegree of φ₁₀,₈' are q²⁸+q²⁶ while  for φ₁₀,₈″ they are q²⁸+q²⁴. The  terms of maximal degree of the fakedegree   of  φ₄₀,₅'  are  q³¹+q²⁹   while  for  φ₄₀,₅″  they  are q³¹+2q²⁹.  The character  φ₁₀,₁₇' is  tensored by  sign of φ₁₀,₈' and φ₄₀,₁₄' is tensored by sign of φ₄₀,₅'.\n\nFor G₃₄:\n\nThe  character φ₂₀,₃₃' occurs in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₅,₁₄. The character φ₇₀,₉' is rational.  The character  φ₇₀,₉″ occurs  in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₅,₁₄.  The character φ₇₀,₄₅'   is  rational.The   character  φ₇₀,₄₅″   is  tensored  by  the determinant  character of  φ₇₀,₉″. The  character φ₅₆₀,₁₈' is rational. The character φ₅₆₀,₁₈‴ occurs in φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇. The character φ₂₈₀,₁₂' occurs    in   φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇.   The   character   φ₂₈₀,₃₀″   occurs   in φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇.  The  character  φ₅₄₀,₂₁'  occurs  in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₀₅,₂₀. The character  φ₁₀₅,₈' is  complex conjugate  of φ₁₀₅,₄,  and φ₈₄₀,₁₃' is complex  conjugate  of  φ₈₄₀,₁₁.  The  character  φ₈₄₀,₂₃'  is  complex conjugate  of  φ₈₄₀,₁₉.  Finally  φ₁₂₀,₂₁'  occurs  in induced from the trivial character of the standard parabolic subgroup of type A₅ generated by the generators of G₃₄ with the third one omitted.\n\nFor  the groups G₅ and G₇ we  adopt the following conventions. For G₅ they are compatible with those of MalleRouquier2003 and BroueMalleMichel2014.\n\nFor G₅:\n\nWe  let W=complex_reflection_group(5),  so the  generators are  W(1) and W(2).\n\nThe  character φ₁,₄' (resp. φ₁,₁₂', φ₂,₃') takes the value 1 (resp. ζ₃,  -ζ₃)  on  W(1).  The  character  φ₁,₈″ is complex conjugate to φ₁,₁₆,  and the character  φ₁,₈' is complex  conjugate to φ₁,₄' . The character  φ₂,₅″ is complex conjugate to  φ₂,₁; φ₂,₅' takes the value -1 on W(1). The character φ₂,₇' is complex conjugate to φ₂,₅'.\n\nFor G₇:\n\nWe  let W=complex_reflection_group(7),  so the  generators are W(1), W(2) and W(3).\n\nThe  characters  φ₁,₄'  and  φ₁,₁₀'  take  the value 1 on W(2). The character  φ₁,₈″ is complex  conjugate to φ₁,₁₆  and φ₁,₈' is complex conjugate  to φ₁,₄'. The characters φ₁,₁₂'  and φ₁,₁₈' take the value ζ₃  on W(2). The character φ₁,₁₄″ is complex conjugate to φ₁,₂₂ and φ₁,₁₄'  is complex conjugate to φ₁,₁₀'. The character φ₂,₃' takes the value  -ζ₃ on  W(2) and  φ₂,₁₃' takes  the value  -1 on W(2). The characters  φ₂,₁₁″, φ₂,₅″, φ₂,₇‴ and  φ₂,₁ are Galois conjugate, as well  as  the  characters  φ₂,₇',  φ₂,₁₃',  φ₂,₁₁'  and  φ₂,₅'. The character  φ₂,₉' is complex  conjugate to φ₂,₁₅  and φ₂,₉‴ is complex conjugate to φ₂,₃'.\n\nFinally,  for the remaining groups G₆, G₈  to G₁₁, G₁₃ to G₂₁, G₂₅, G₂₆,  G₃₂ and G₃₃ there are only  pairs of characters with same value (d,b).  We give labels uniformly to these characters by applying in order the following rules :\n\nIf the two characters have  different fake degrees, label φ_{d,b}' the  one  whose  fake  degree  is  minimal  for  the  lexicographic  order of  polynomials (starting with the highest term).\nFor the not yet labeled pairs, if only one of the two characters has the  property   that  in  its   Galois  orbit  at   least  one  character  is  distinguished by its (d,b)-invariant, label it φ_{d,b}'.\nFor the not yet labeled pairs,  if the minimum of the (d,b)-value (for  the  lexicographic  order  (d,b))  in  the  Galois  orbits  of the two  character  is different, label φ_{d,b}' the character with the minimal  minimum.\nWe define now a new invariant  for characters: consider all the pairs of  irreducible   characters  χ  and  ψ  uniquely  determined  by  their  (d,b)-invariant such that φ occurs with non-zero multiplicity m in  χ⊗ψ.  We define  t(φ) to  be the  minimal (for  lexicographic order)  possible list (d(χ),b(χ),d(ψ),b(ψ),m).\n\nFor  the not  yet labeled  pairs, if  the t-invariants are different, label φ_{d,b}' the character with the minimal t-invariant.\n\nAfter  applying  the  last  rule  all  the  pairs  will be labelled for the considered  groups. The labelling obtained  is compatible for G₂₅, G₂₆, G₃₂  and G₃₃  with that  of Malle2000  and for G₈ with that described in MalleRouquier2003.\n\nWe  should  emphasize  that  for  all  groups  with  a  few exceptions, the parameters  for characters do  not depend on  any non-canonical choice. The exceptions  are G(de,e,n) with e>1, and G₅, G₇, G₂₇, G₂₈, G₂₉ and  G₃₄, groups  which admit  outer automorphisms  preserving the set of reflections,  so choices  of a  particular value  on a particular generator must be made for characters which are not invariant by these automorphisms.\n\nLabels  for the classes. For the exceptional complex reflection groups, the labels  for the classes represent the  decomposition of a representative of the  class as a product of generators, with the additional conventions that 'z'  represents the generator  of the center  and for well-generated groups 'c'  represents a Coxeter element  (a product of the  generators which is a regular element for the highest reflection degree).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"chars.html#Chevie.Chars.CharTable","page":"Classes/characters of reflection groups","title":"Chevie.Chars.CharTable","text":"CharTable is a structure to hold character tables of groups and Hecke  algebras\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"chars.html#Chevie.Chars.on_chars","page":"Classes/characters of reflection groups","title":"Chevie.Chars.on_chars","text":"on_chars(G,aut)\n\naut  is an automorphism of  the group G (for  a permutation group, this could  be  given  as  a  permutation  normalizing  G).

For an irreducible W see the helpstring for Chars for what are the parameters.\n\njulia> charinfo(coxgroup(:G,2)).charparams\n6-element Vector{Vector{Vector{Int64}}}:\n [[1, 0]]\n [[1, 6]]\n [[1, 3, 1]]\n [[1, 3, 2]]\n [[2, 1]]\n [[2, 2]]\n\njulia> charinfo(coxgroup(:G,2))\n┌──┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│n0│ name ext b B a A spaltenstein lusztig              symbol│\n├──┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│1 │ φ₁‚₀  Id 0 0 0 0            1       1       (0,0,0,0,0,2)│\n│2 │ φ₁‚₆ det 6 6 6 6            ε       ε (01,01,01,01,01,12)│\n│3 │φ′₁‚₃     3 3 1 5           εₗ      ε′            (0,0,1+)│\n│4 │φ″₁‚₃     3 3 1 5          ε_c      ε″            (0,0,1-)│\n│5 │ φ₂‚₁  Λ¹ 1 5 1 5           θ′      θ′       (0,0,0,0,1,1)│\n│6 │ φ₂‚₂     2 4 1 5           θ″      θ″       (0,0,0,1,0,1)│\n└──┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nIn  the table printed  at the Repl,  the columns reflect  various fields of charinfo.  The  column  name  reflects  the  field .charnames, a name computed  from .charparams. This  is the same  as charnames(io,W) where here io being the Repl has the property :limit true.\n\nThe   column   ext   shows   the   exterior   powers  of  the  reflection representation.  It corresponds  to the  field .extrefl  which is present only  if W  is irreducible.  Otherwise, only  two items  are shown in the column:  Id corresponds to the field  .positionId and shows the trivial character.  det  corresponds  to  the  field .positionDet and shows the determinant  character (for Coxeter groups the sign character). When W is irreducible,  the characters marked  Λⁱ are the  i-th exterior power of the  reflection  representation.  They  are  irreducible  by  a  theorem of Steinberg.\n\nThe  column  b  shows  the  field  .b  listing  for  each character the valuation  of the fake degree, and the column B shows the field .B, the degree of the fake degree.\n\nThe  columns a and  A only appear  for Spetsial groups. They correspond then  to the fields  .a and .A,  and contain respectively the valuation and the degree of the generic degree of the character (in the one-parameter Hecke algebra hecke(W,Pol()) for W).\n\nFor  irreducible  groups,  the  table  shows  sometimes additional columns, corresponding to a field of the same name.\n\nfor  F₄, the column kondo gives the labeling of the characters given by Kondo, also used in Lusztig1985, (4.10).\n\nfor  E₆, E₇, E₈ the  column frame gives the  labeling of the characters given   by  Frame,   also  used   in  Lusztig1985,   (4.11),  (4.12),  and (4.13).\n\nfor  G₂ the  column spaltenstein  gives the  labeling of the characters given by Spaltenstein.\n\nfor G(de,e,2) even e and d>1, the column malle gives the parameters for the characters used in Malle1996.\n\nIf  W  is  irreducible  spetsial  and  imprimitive,  the  column 'symbol(corresponding  to the field.charSymbols`) shows the  symbol attached to the corresponding unipotent caracter.\n\nIf  W  isa  Spets,  the  column  restr.  (corresponding  to  the  field .charRestrictions)  gives the  number of  the corresponding  character of Group(W).\n\nFinally,  the  field  .hgal  contains  the  permutation of the characters resulting  from a Galois  action on the  characters of H=hecke(W,Pol()^e) where  e is the order of  the center of W. H  splits by taking v an e-th root of Pol(), and .hgal records the permutation effected by the Galois action v->E(e)*v (charinfo does not have the key :hgal if this permutation   is  trivial).  .hgal*conj,  where  conj  is  the  complex conjugaison, is the Opdam involution.\n\njulia> charinfo(complex_reflection_group(24))\n┌──┬─────────────────────┐\n│n0│ name ext  b  B  a  A│\n├──┼─────────────────────┤\n│1 │ φ₁‚₀  Id  0  0  0  0│\n│2 │φ₁‚₂₁ det 21 21 21 21│\n│3 │ φ₃‚₈      8 18  8 20│\n│4 │ φ₃‚₁  Λ¹  1 11  1 13│\n│5 │φ₃‚₁₀  Λ² 10 20  8 20│\n│6 │ φ₃‚₃      3 13  1 13│\n│7 │ φ₆‚₂      2 12  1 13│\n│8 │ φ₆‚₉      9 19  8 20│\n│9 │ φ₇‚₆      6 18  6 18│\n│10│ φ₇‚₃      3 15  3 15│\n│11│ φ₈‚₄      4 16  4 17│\n│12│ φ₈‚₅      5 17  4 17│\n└──┴─────────────────────┘\nhgal=(11,12)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"chars.html#Chevie.Chars.charnames-Tuple{IO, Union{Coset, Group}}","page":"Classes/characters of reflection groups","title":"Chevie.Chars.charnames","text":"charnames(ComplexReflectionGroup or Spets;options...) charnames(io::IO,ComplexReflectionGroup or Spets)\n\nreturns  the list of character names for the reflection group or Spets W.

An equivalence  class has  exactly one member which does not contain 0: it is called a normalized β-set.\n\nTo  a  normalized  partition  p₁≥p₂≥…pₙ>0  is  associated  a β-set, whose normalized  representative  is  pₙ,pₙ₋₁+1,…,p₁+n-1.

An e-symbol is  a vector S=[S₁,…,Sₑ] of β-sets, taken modulo the equivalence relation generated by the simultaneous elementary  shift of all β-sets, and by  cyclic permutations of S; in the particular  case where e=2, S is thus  an unordered pair of β-sets. S is  a normalized symbol  if 0 is  not in the  intersection of the Sᵢ; equivalent  normalized symbols  are equivalent  by cyclic  permutation. The content  of  S  is  mod(c,e)  where  c=sum(length.(S));  it  is  an invariant  of the symbol, as well as  the rank, defined for an e-symbol as  sum(sum,S)-div((c-1)*(c-e+1),2*e). Invariant by  shift but not cyclic permutation is the shape s.-minimum(s) where s=length.(S).\n\nWhen  e=2 we  choose representatives  of the  symbols [S₁,S₂] such that length(S₁)≥length(S₂),  so the shape is [d,0] for some d≥0 called the defect  of the  symbol; the  content is  equal to mod(d,2). For symbols [S₁,S₂] with length(S₁)==length(S₂) we choose representatives such that P₁≤P₂  lexicographically where  P₁,P₂ are  the partitions associated to S₁,S₂.\n\nPartitions  and  pairs  of  partitions  parametrize  characters of the Weyl groups  of classical types, and tuples of partitions parametrize characters of  imprimitive complex reflection  groups. 2-Symbols parametrize unipotent characters  of  classical  Chevalley  groups,  and more general e-symbols parametrize   unipotent  characters  of   Spetses  associated  to  spetsial imprimitive complex reflection groups. The rank of a symbol is equal to the semi-simple rank of the corresponding Chevalley group or Spets.\n\nSymbols of rank n and defect 0 parametrize characters of the Weyl group of  type  Dₙ,  and  symbols  of  rank  n  and  defect  divisible by 4 parameterize  unipotent characters of split  orthogonal groups of dimension 2n.  Symbols of  rank n  and defect≡2  (mod 4) parameterize unipotent characters  of non-split  orthogonal groups  of dimension  2n.

An eigenvector r∈ V of s  for the eigenvalue  ζₛ is called  a root of  s and a linear form rᵛ on V of kernel Hₛ is called a coroot of s. If r and rᵛ are normalized  so that  rᵛ(r)=1-ζ, then  s is  the map  on V  defined by s(x)=x-rᵛ(x)r. Such a normalized root and coroot for s are unique up to scaling the root and inversely scaling the coroot.\n\nA  finite  complex  reflection  group  W  is  a finite group generated by complex  reflections.  Since  whenever  W  contains  a  reflection s it contains  its powers, W is always  generated by reflections s such that ζₛ==E(d)  where d is the  order of s; we  can also assume that s is not  a power of another reflection with larger order d. Such a reflection is  called a distinguished reflection of W; it is a canonical generator of  the cyclic  subgroup of  W centralizing  Hₛ. The  generators of the complex   reflection   groups   we   construct   are  always  distinguished reflections; the set of distinguished reflections are in bijection with the reflecting  hyperplanes.  In  a  real  reflection group all reflections are distinguished.\n\nIt  is much  more efficient  to compute  with permutation  groups than with matrix  groups; hence we use for computing with a finite complex reflection group  W a permutation representation on  a W-invariant set of root and coroot vectors for reflections of W; that is, a set R of pairs (r,rᵛ)∈ V×Vᵛ  invariant by W and such that every distinguished reflection in W is determined by some pair in R (see reflectionMatrix). Using a W-invariant  set implies that there may  be several pairs determining the same reflection, which differ by roots of unity. This generalizes the usual construction  for Coxeter groups (the case K=ℝ) where to each reflection of  W  is  associated  two  roots,  one  positive  and  one negative. \n\nA  complex reflection group  is irreducible if  the representation V is irreducible.  For irreducible complex reflection groups, there are at least as many roots for a given reflection as the order of the center of W.\n\nThe  following  methods  are  always  defined for finite complex reflection groups:\n\ngens(W): the (distinguished) reflections which generate W, given as permutations of the roots. reflrep(W) gives them as matrices.\nroots(W): the list of roots of W.\ncoroots(W): the list of coroots, in the same order as the roots.\nrefls(W):  a list of  distinguished reflections of  W, as permutations. This list is of same length as the roots, and its i-th element is the distinguished   reflection  for  the  i-th  root,  so  it  will  have repetitions. unique_refls(W) returns a sublist of 1:length(roots(W)) such that the distinguished reflections around the corresponding  roots reach one time  only each distinguished reflection of W.\n\nThe  lists roots, coroots and refls starts with the \"generating\" ones (those corresponding to gens(W)).\n\nsimpleroots(W):  the generating roots as a matrix.\nsimplecoroots(W):  the generating coroots as a matrix.\nreflections(W) gives a list without repetitions of all reflections of W   (not   only   the   distinguished   ones),  as  objects  of  type Reflection.  These objects  contain more  information on each reflection.\n\nThe  finite  irreducible  complex  reflection  groups  have been completely classified  by Shephard and  Todd, see ShephardTodd1954. They  consist of one infinite family  G(de,e,r) depending on 3 parameters (which  includes the infinite families of  Weyl groups), and 34 exceptional groups  which have been given  by Shephard and Todd  names which range from G₄  to  G₃₇.  These  exceptional  groups  include  the exceptional Weyl groups, e.g., coxgroup(:E,8) is the same as G₃₇.\n\nWe provide functions to build any finite reflection group, either by giving a  list  of  roots  and  coroots  defining  the generating reflections (see PRG), or in terms of the classification (see complex_reflection_group).  In the  context e.g.  of Weyl groups, one  wants to  describe the  particular root  system chosen  in term of the traditional  classification of crystallographic root  systems. This is done via   calls  to  the  function   coxeter_group  (see  the  module Weyl).  There is not yet  a general theory on  how to construct a nice  set of roots for  a non-real reflection group;  the roots chosen here where  obtained  case-by-case;  however,  they  satisfy  several  important properties:\n\nThe generating reflections  satisfy braid relations  which present the braid group associated to W (see diagram).\nThe field  of definition  of W  is the  field K generated by the traces  of the elements of W acting on  V. It is a theorem that W may be realized as a reflection group over K.\nThe Cartan matrix rᵛ(r') where r and r' runs over the roots and coroots  for the generating reflections has entries in the ring ℤₖ of integers  of  K,  and  the  other  roots  (resp.  coroots) are linear combinations with coefficients in ℤₖ of a linearly independent subset of them.\n\nIt  turns out that all representations of W are defined over the field of definition K (see. Benard1976 and D.~Bessis' thesis). This  has been known for a  long time in the case  K=ℚ, the case of Weyl groups, whose representations are all integral.\n\njulia> W=complex_reflection_group(4)\nG₄\n\njulia> gens(W) # as permutations of the 24 roots\n2-element Vector{Perm{Int16}}:\n (1,3,9)(2,4,7)(5,10,18)(6,11,16)(8,12,19)(13,15,20)(14,17,21)(22,23,24)\n (1,5,13)(2,6,10)(3,7,14)(4,8,15)(9,16,22)(11,12,17)(18,19,23)(20,21,24)\n\njulia> length(unique(refls(W)))\n4\n\njulia> length(refls(W)) # 24=4*(number of roots of unity in ℚ (ζ₃))\n24\n\njulia> reflrep(W) # the generators as matrices\n2-element Vector{Matrix{Cyc{Rational{Int64}}}}:\n [1 0; 0 ζ₃]\n [√-3/3 -ζ₃²√-3/3; (-3+√-3)/3 -ζ₃√-3/3]\n\nFor  almost  all  irreducible  complex  reflection  groups,  the generating matrices  for W we give have coefficients in the field of definition K. Further,  the set of matrices for all elements of W is globally invariant under  the  Galois  group  of  K/ℚ,  thus  the  Galois  action  induces automorphisms  of W. The exceptions are G₂₂, G₂₇ where the matrices are in  a  degree  two  extension  of  K  (this  is needed to have a globally invariant  model, see MarinMichel2010) and some dihedral  groups, as well as  H₃ and H₄, where  the matrices given (the usual   Coxeter  reflection  representation  over  K)  are  not  globally invariant (but one can get invariant ones by chevieget(:H4,:InvariantModel)).\n\njulia> braid_relations(W) # as tuples of equal words in the generators\n1-element Vector{Tuple{Vector{Int64}, Vector{Int64}}}:\n ([1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2])\n\njulia> diagram(W) # the same in pictures\n③ ——③ G₄\n1   2\n\njulia> cartan(W)\n2×2 Matrix{Cyc{Rational{Int64}}}:\n ζ₃²√-3     ζ₃²\n   -ζ₃²  ζ₃²√-3\n\njulia> simpleroots(W)\n2×2 Matrix{Cyc{Rational{Int64}}}:\n    0  ζ₃²√-3\n 2ζ₃²     ζ₃²\n\njulia> simplecoroots(W)\n2×2 Matrix{Cyc{Rational{Int64}}}:\n     0      1\n √-3/3  √-3/3\n\nLet SV be the symmetric algebra of V.

The polynomials fᵢ are not uniquely determined but their  degrees are. The fᵢ are called  the basic invariants of W, and their  degrees the reflection  degrees of W;  the function degrees(W) returns these invariants.\n\nLet  I be the  ideal generated by  the homogeneous invariants of positive degree  in SV. Then SV/I is isomorphic to the regular representation of W  as a  W-module. It  is thus  a graded  (by the degree of elements of SV)  version of the  regular representation of  W.

We say that F₀∈ GL(V)  is an  automorphism of  R if  it permutes  R and is of finite order  (finite  order  is  automatic  if  R generates V). It follows by chap.  VI,  §1.1,  lemme  1  Bourbaki1968 that the dual F₀*∈  GL(V*)  permutes  the  coroots  R*⊂  V*; thus F₀ normalizes the reflection  group  W  associated  to  R,  that  is  w↦  F₀wF₀⁻¹ is an automorphism  of W. Thus we get a reflection coset WF₀, which we call a Coxeter coset.\n\nThe  motivation for introducing Coxeter  cosets comes from automorphisms of algebraic  reductive groups, giving rise to non-split reductive groups over finite fields. Let 𝐆 be a connected reductive algebraic group 𝐆 over an algebraic  closure 𝔽̄_q of a finite field 𝔽_q, defined over 𝔽_q; this corresponds  to a  Frobenius endomorphism  F so  that the finite group of rational  points 𝐆(𝔽_q) identifies to the  subgroup 𝐆^F of fixed points under F.\n\nLet 𝐓 be a maximal torus of 𝐆, and Φ (resp. Φ*) be the roots (resp. coroots)  of 𝐆 with respect  to 𝐓 in the  character group X(𝐓) (resp. the  group of one-parameter subgroups Y(𝐓)). Then 𝐆 is determined up to isomorphism  by (X(𝐓),Φ,Y(𝐓),Φ*); this corresponds  to give a root system in   the  vector  space  V=ℚ ⊗ X(𝐓)   and  a  rational  reflection  group W=N_𝐆(𝐓)/𝐓 acting on it.\n\nIf  𝐓 is F-stable the Frobenius endomorphism F acts also naturally on X(T)  and defines thus  an endomorphism of  V, which is  of the form q F₀, where F₀∈ GL(V) is of finite order and normalizes W. We get thus a Coxeter  coset WF₀⊂GL(V).  The data  (X(𝐓), Φ,  Y(𝐓), Φ*,  F₀), and the integer   q  completely  determine  up   to  isomorphism  the  associated reductive finite group 𝐆^F. Thus these data is a way of representing in the  essential  information  which  determines  a  finite  reductive group. Indeed, all properties of Chevalley groups can be computed from that datum: symbols  representing characters, conjugacy classes,  and finally the whole character table of 𝐆^F.\n\nIt  turns out that  many interesting objects  attached to this datum depend only on (V,W, F₀): the order of the maximal tori, the fake degrees, the order  of 𝐆^F, symbols representing unipotent characters, Deligne-Lusztig induction  in  terms  of  almost  characters, the Fourier matrix relating characters and almost characters, etc… (see, e.g., Broue-Malle-Michel1993).  It is thus possible to extend their  construction to non-crystallographic groups (or even to more general complex  reflection groups,  see spets);  this is  why we did not include  a root  system in  the definition  of a reflection coset. However, unipotent conjugacy classes for instance depend on the root system.\n\nWe assume now that 𝐓 is contained in an F-stable Borel subgroup of 𝐆. This  defines an order  on the roots,  and there is  a unique element ϕ∈ W F₀,  the  reduced  element  of  the  coset,  which  preserves the set of positive  roots.  It  thus  defines  a  diagram  automorphism, that is an automorphism  of the Coxeter system (W,S).  This element is stored in the component  .phi of the coset record. It may be defined without mentioning the  roots,  as  follows:  (W,F₀(S))  is  another  Coxeter  system,  thus conjugate to S by a unique element of W, thus there is a unique element ϕ∈  WF₀ which stabilizes S (a proof  follows from Theoreme 1, chap. V, §3  Bourbaki1968). We  consider thus  cosets of the form Wϕ where ϕ stabilizes S. The coset W ϕ is completely defined by the permutation  .phi  when  𝐆  is  semi-simple  –-  equivalently when Φ generates  V; in this  case we just  need to specify  phi to define the coset.\n\nThere is a slight generalisation of the above setup, covering in particular the  case of the Ree  and Suzuki groups. We  consider 𝐆^F where F not a Frobenius  endomorphism, but  an isogeny  such that  some power  F^n is a Frobenius endomorphism. Then F still defines an endomorphism of V which normalizes  W; we define a real number q such that F^n is attached to an  𝔽_{qⁿ}-structure. Then we still have F=q F₀ where F₀ is of finite order  but q is no more an integer.  Thus F₀∈ GL(V⊗ ℝ) but F₀∉ GL(V). For  instance, for the  Ree and Suzuki  groups, F₀ is  an automorphism of order  2 of W, which is of type G₂, B₂ or F₄, and q=√2 for B₂ and  F₄ and q=√3  for G₂ This  can be constructed  starting from root systems  for G₂, B₂ or  F₄ where all the  roots have the same length. This kind of root system is not crystallographic. Such non-crystallographic  root systems exist for all finite Coxeter groups such as  the dihedral groups, H₃ and H₄. We will call here Weyl cosets the cosets  corresponding to rational forms  of algebraic groups, which include thus some non-rational roots systems for B₂, G₂ and F₄.\n\nSpets\n\nWe  now extend the above notions  to general complex reflection groups. Let W⊂  GL(V) be a complex reflection group  on the vector space V. Let ϕ be  an element  of GL(V)  which normalizes  W. Then  the coset  Wϕ is called a reflection coset.\n\nA reference for these cosets is Broue-Malle-Michel 1999. When W is a so-called Spetsial group, they are the basic object for the construction  of  a  Spetses,  which  is  an object attached to a complex reflection  group from which one can derive combinatorially some attributes shared with finite reductive groups, like unipotent degrees, etc….\n\nWe  say that  a reflection  coset is  irreducible if  W is irreducible. A general  coset is a direct  product of descents of  scalars, which is the case  where ϕ  is transitive  on the  irreducible components  of W. The irreducible    cosets   have   been   classified   in   Broue-Malle-Michel 1999:  up to multiplication of ϕ by a scalar, there is usually only one or two possible cosets for a given irreducible group.\n\nWe  deal only  with finite  order cosets,  that is,  we assume there is a (minimal) integer δ such that (Wϕ)^δ=W. Then the group generated by W and ϕ is finite, of order δ|W|.\n\nA  subset C  of a  Wϕ is  called a  conjugacy class  if one of the following equivalent conditions is fulfilled:\n\nC is the orbit of an element in Wϕ under the conjugation action of W.\nC is a conjugacy class of ⟨W,ϕ⟩ contained in Wϕ.\nThe set {w∈ W|wϕ∈ C} is  a ϕ-conjugacy  class of W (two elements\n\nv,w∈  W are called ϕ-conjugate, if and only if there exists x∈ W with v=xwϕ(x⁻¹)).\n\nAn irreducible character of ⟨W,ϕ⟩ has some non-zero values on Wϕ if and only if its restriction to W is irreducible. Further, two characters χ₁ and  χ₂  which  have  same  irreducible  restriction  to  W differ by a character  of  the  cyclic  group  ⟨ϕ⟩  (which identifies to the quotient ⟨W,ϕ⟩/W). A set containing one extension to ⟨W,ϕ⟩ of each ϕ-invariant character  of W is called a set  of irreducible characters of Wϕ. Two such  characters  are  orthogonal  for  the  scalar  product  on  the class functions on Wϕ given by χψ=W¹_w Wχ(wϕ)overlineψ(wϕ) For rational groups (Weyl groups), Lusztig has defined a choice of a set of irreducible  characters for  Wϕ (called  the preferred extensions), but for  more  general  reflection  cosets  we  have made some rather arbitrary choices,  which  however  have  the  property  that their values lie in the smallest possible field.\n\nThe  character  table  of  Wϕ  is  the  table  of  values  of  a set of irreducible characters on the conjugacy classes.\n\nA subcoset Lwϕ of Wϕ is given by a reflection subgroup L of W and an element w of W such that wϕ normalizes L.\n\nWe  then have a natural notion of  restriction of class functions on Wϕ to  class  functions  on  Lwϕ  as  well  as  of  induction in the other direction.  These  maps  are  adjoint  with  respect  to the scalar product defined above (see Broue-Malle-Michel 1999).\n\nIn  this package the most general construction  of a reflection coset is by starting  from a reflection datum, and giving in addition the matrix F of the  map ϕ:V→ V  (see the command  spets). However, at present, general cosets are only implemented for groups represented as permutation groups on a  set of roots, and  it is required that  the automorphism given preserves this  set up to  a scalar (it  is allowed that  these scalars depend on the pair  of an  irreducible component  and its  image). It  is also allowed to specify  ϕ by the permutation it induces on the roots; in this case it is assumed  that ϕ acts  trivially on the  orthogonal of the  roots, but the roots  could be those of a parent group, generating a larger space. Thus in any  case we have  a permutation representation  of ⟨W,ϕ⟩ and we consider the coset to be a set of permutations.\n\nReflection  cosets  are  implemented  in  by  a  struct which points to a reflection  group  record  and  has  additional  fields holding F and the corresponding  permutation phi. In the general case, on each component of W  which is  a descent  of scalars,  F will  permute the components and differ  by a scalar on each  component from an automorphism which preserves the  roots. In this case, we have  a permutation phi and a scalar which is stored for that component.\n\nThe  most common situation where cosets  with non-trivial phi arise is as sub-cosets  of reflection groups. Here is an \"exotic\" example, see the next chapter for more classical examples involving Coxeter groups.\n\njulia> W=complex_reflection_group(14)\nG₁₄\n\njulia> R=reflection_subgroup(W,[2,4])\nG₁₄₍₂₄₎=G₅\n\njulia> RF=spets(R,W(1)) # should be ²G₅(√6)\nG₁₄₍₂₄₎=²G₅\n\njulia> diagram(RF)\nϕ acts as (1,2) on the component below\n③ ══③ G₅\n1   2\n\njulia> degrees(RF)\n2-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Cyc{Int64}}}:\n (6, 1)\n (12, -1)\n\nThe  last line shows for each  reflection degree the corresponding factor of  the coset, which is  the scalar by which  ϕ acts on the corresponding fundamental reflection invariant.

For  irreducible  characters of Weyl cosets,  we choose (following Lusztig) for each ϕ-stable character of W a  particular extension to a character of  W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩, which we will call the preferred extension. The character table of the coset Wϕ is the table of  the restrictions to  Wϕ of the  preferred extensions. The question of finding the conjugacy classes and character table of a Coxeter coset can be reduced to the case of irreducible root systems R.\n\nThe automorphism ϕ permutes the irreducible components of W, and Wϕ  is a direct  product of cosets  where ϕ permutes cyclically the irreducible components of W. The preferred extension is defined to be the  direct  product  of  the  preferred  extension  in  each  of these situations.\nAssume now that Wϕ is a descent of scalars, that is the decomposition in irreducible components W=W₁× ⋯ × Wₖ is cyclically permuted by ϕ. Then there are natural bijections from the ϕ-conjugacy classes of W to  the ϕᵏ-conjugacy classes  of W₁ as  well as from the ϕ-stable characters  of W to the ϕᵏ-stable  characters of W₁, which reduce the  definition of preferred  extensions on Wϕ  to the definition for W₁ϕᵏ.\nAssume now  that W  is the  Coxeter group  of an  irreducible root system.   ϕ  permutes  the  simple   roots,  hence  induces  a  graph automorphism  on  the  corresponding  Dynkin  diagram.  If  ϕ=1  then conjugacy  classes and  characters coincide  with those  of the Coxeter group W.\n\nThe  nontrivial cases for crystallographic roots  systems are (the order of ϕ  is written as left exponent to  the type): ²Aₙ, ²Dₙ, ³D₄, ²E₆. For  non-crystallographic root  systems where  all the  roots have the same length the additional cases ²B₂, ²G₂, ²F₄ and ²I₂(k) arise.\n\nIn  case  ³D₄  the  group  W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩  can be embedded into the Coxeter  group of type F₄, which induces a labeling for the conjugacy classes of the coset. The preferred extension is chosen as the (single) extension with rational values.\nIn case  ²Dₙ the  group W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩  is isomorphic  to a Coxeter group of type Bₙ. This induces a canonical labeling for the conjugacy classes  of the coset and allows to define the preferred extension in a combinatorial  way  using  the  labels  (pairs  of  partitions) for the characters of the Coxeter group of type Bₙ.\nIn the remaining crystallographic cases ϕ identifies to -w₀ where w₀  is the longest element of W.  So, there is a canonical labeling of  the conjugacy classes and characters of  the coset by those of W. The  preferred extensions  are defined  by describing  the signs of the character values on -w₀.\n\nThe  most general  construction of  a Coxeter  coset is  by starting from a Coxeter   datum   specified   by   the   matrices   of   simpleRoots  and simplecoroots,  and  giving  in  addition  the  matrix F0Mat of the map F₀:V→ V (see the commands  CoxeterCoset and CoxeterSubCoset). As for Coxeter  groups,  the  elements  of  Wϕ  are  uniquely  determined by the permutation  they  induce  on  the  set  of  roots  R.  We consider these permutations as elements of the Coxeter coset.\n\nCoxeter  cosets are implemented by a struct which points to a Coxeter datum record  and  has  additional  fields  holding F0Mat and the corresponding element  phi. Functions on the coset (for example, classinfo) are about properties  of  the  group  coset  W  ϕ  ;  however, most definitions for elements of untwisted Coxeter groups apply without change to elements in W ϕ:  e.g., if we define the length of  an element wϕ∈ Wϕ as the number of positive  roots it sends to negative ones, it  is the same as the length of w,  i.e., ϕ is of length 0, since ϕ has been chosen to preserve the set of positive roots. Similarly, the Coxeter word describing wϕ is the same as the one for w, etc…\n\nWe associate to a Coxeter coset Wϕ a twisted Dynkin diagram, consisting of  the Dynkin diagram of W and  the graph automorphism induced by ϕ on this  diagram (this specifies the  group W⋊ ⟨F⟩, mentioned above, up to  isomorphism). See the  functions ReflectionType, ReflectionName and diagram for Coxeter cosets.\n\nBelow  is an example showing first how to not define, then how to define, the Weyl coset for a Suzuki group:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:B,2)\nB₂\n\njulia> spets(W,Perm(1,2))\nERROR: matrix F must preserve the roots\nStacktrace:\n [1] error(::String) at ./error.jl:33\n [2] spets(::Chevie.Weyl.FCG{Int16,Int64,PRG{Int64,Int16}}, ::Matrix{Int64}) at /home/jmichel/julia/Chevie/src/Cosets.jl:241 (repeats 2 times)\n [3] top-level scope at REPL[19]:1\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:Bsym,2)\nBsym₂\n\njulia> WF=spets(W,Perm(1,2))\n²Bsym₂\n\njulia> CharTable(WF)\nCharTable(²Bsym₂)\n┌───┬─────────┐\n│   │    1 121│\n├───┼─────────┤\n│2. │1   1   1│\n│.11│1  -1  -1│\n│1.1│. -√2  √2│\n└───┴─────────┘\n\nA subcoset Hwϕ of Wϕ is given by a reflection subgroup H of W and an  element w of W  such that wϕ induces  an automorphism of the root system of H.

They have groups of fractions which in both examples are the braid group. Here we implement braid groups in the framework of a general implementation of Garside monoids and groups.\n\nTo  define Garside monoids we  introduce some vocabulary about divisibility in  monoids. A left-divisor  of x is  a d such  that there exists y with  x=dy (and then  we say that  x is a  right multiple of d, and write  d≼ x). We say that a monoid M is left cancellable if an equality dx=dy   implies  x=y.  We  define  symmetrically  right-divisors,  left multiples and right cancellability. We say that x is an atom if 1 and x  are its only  divisors. A left  gcd of x  and y is a common left divisor  d of x  and y such  that any other  common left-divisor is a left-divisor  of d. Similarly  a right lcm  of x and  y is a common multiple which is a left-divisor of any other common multiple.\n\nWe  call Garside a monoid M which:\n\nis left and right cancellable.\nis generated by its atoms.\nadmits left and  right  gcds  and  lcms.\nis such that any element has only finitely many left (or right) divisors.\nadmits a Garside element, which is an element Δ whose set of left and right-divisors coincide and generate M.\n\nGarside  elements are not  unique, but there  is a unique  minimal one (for divisibility);  we assume that a Garside  element Δ has been chosen. Then the  divisors of  Δ are  called the  simples of  M. A  Garside monoid embeds  into its group of  fractions, which is called  a Garside group (a group  can have  several different  Garside structures,  for instance braid groups of finite Coxeter groups have an ordinary and a dual braid monoid).\n\nWe  also implement locally Garside monoids,  which are monoids where lcms do  not always exist, but  exist if any common  multiple exists; the set of simples is then not defined by a Garside element, but by the condition that they  contain the atoms and are closed  under lcms and taking divisors (see BDM01); since this is not ensured by the existence of a Garside  element,  one  has  to  add  the  condition  that  each element is divisible  by  finitely  many  simples  (but  the  number of simples can be infinite).  The most important  example is the  Artin monoid of an infinite Coxeter  group. It is not known whether  these monoids embed in their group of  fractions (although this  has been proved  for Artin monoids of Coxeter groups  by Paris  Paris01) and  thus computing in the monoid  does  not  help  for  computing  in  the  group; only the monoid is implemented here for these cases.\n\nWhat allows computing with Garside and locally Garside monoids, and Garside groups,  is the fact  that they admit  normal forms –-  these normal forms were   exhibited   for   braid   monoids   of  Coxeter  groups  by  Deligne Del72,  who extended  earlier work  of Brieskorn, Saito BS72 and Garside Gar69:\n\nLet M be a locally Garside monoid. Then for b∈ M there is a unique  maximal simple left-divisor α(b) of b; any other simple dividing b divides α(b).\nLet M be a Garside monoid with Garside element Δ and group of fractions G. Then for any x∈  G, for large enough i we have Δⁱx∈ M.\n\nA  consequence of 1. is that every element has a canonical decomposition as a  product of  simples, called  its left-greedy  normal form.  If we define ω(x) by x=α(x)ω(x), then the normal form of x is α(x)α(ω(x))α(ω^2(x))…  We use  the normal  form to  represent elements of M,  and when M is Garside we use 2. to represent elements of G: given x∈  G we  compute the  smallest power  i such  that Δⁱ  x∈ M,  and we represent x by the pair (i,Δ⁻ⁱx). We are thus reduced to the case where x∈  M, not divisible  by Δ, where  we represent x  by the sequence of simples that make up its normal form.\n\nWe  now describe Artin-Tits braid monoids. Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system, that is W has presentation\n\n⟨s∈ S∣s²=1, sts⋯ =tst⋯   (mₛₜ factors on each side) for s,t∈ S⟩\n\nfor some Coxeter matrix mₛₜ. The braid group B associated to (W,S) is the group defined by the presentation\n\n⟨𝐬∈ 𝐒∣ 𝐬𝐭𝐬⋯ =𝐭𝐬𝐭⋯  (mₛₜ factors on each side) for 𝐬,𝐭∈ 𝐒⟩\n\nThe  positive braid monoid B⁺ associated with W is the monoid defined by  the  presentation  above  –-  it  identifies with the submonoid of B generated  by 𝐒 by Paris01.  This monoid is locally Garside,  with the set of simples in bijection with the elements of W and with  𝐒 as atoms; we will denote by 𝐖 the set of simples, and by 𝐰 ↦ w  the bijection between simples and elements  of W. The group W has a length  defined  in  terms  of  reduced expressions. Similarly, having only homogeneous relations, B⁺ has a natural length function. Then 𝐖 can be characterised  as the subset  of elements of  B⁺ with the  same length as their image in W.\n\nIf  W is finite, then B⁺ is Garside with Garside element the element of 𝐖 whose image is the longest element  of W. A finite Coxeter group is also  a reflection group in  a real vector space,  thus in its complexified V,  and B also has a topological definition as the fundamental group of the  space Vʳᵉᵍ/W, where Vʳᵉᵍ  is the set of  elements of V which are not fixed by any non-identity element of S; however, we will not use this here.\n\nWe  implement in general only  monoids which have a  finite number of atoms (there  an implementation following the work of François Digne for the dual braid monoid of the affine Coxeter group W(Ãₙ)).\n\nGiven a Coxeter group W,\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,4)\nA₄\n\njulia> B=BraidMonoid(W)\nBraidMonoid(A₄)\n\nconstructs  the associated braid monoid, and  then, used as a function, B constructs  elements of the braid monoid (or group when W is finite) from a list of generators:\n\njulia> w=B(1,2,3,4) # represents 𝐬₁𝐬₂𝐬₃𝐬₄\n1234\n\njulia> w^3  # the terms of the normal form are printed separated by a .\n121321432.343\n\njulia> word(α(w^3))\n9-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 3\n 2\n 1\n 4\n 3\n 2\n\njulia> w^4\nΔ.232432\n\njulia> inv(w)\n(1234)⁻¹\n\nHow  an  element  of  a  Garside  group  is  printed  is  controlled by the IOcontext  attribute  ':greedy'.  By  default,  elements  are  printed as fractions a⁻¹b where a and b have no left common divisor. Each of a and  b is printed  using its left-greedy  normal form, that  is a maximal power of the Garside element followed by the rest. One can print the entire element   in  the  left-greedy  normal  from  by  setting  the  IOContext :greedy=>true; with the same w as above we have:\n\njulia> xrepr(w^-1,greedy=true,limit=true)\n\"Δ⁻¹.232432\"\n\nBy default,  repr gives   w  back   in  a   form  which   after  assigning B=BraidMonoid(W) can be input back into Julia:\n\njulia> repr(w)\n\"B(1,2,3,4)\"\n\njulia> repr(w^3)\n\"B(1,2,1,3,2,1,4,3,2,3,4,3)\"\n\njulia> repr(w^-1)\n\"B(-4,-3,-2,-1)\"\n\nIn  general elements of a  Garside monoid are displayed  as a list of their constituting atoms.\n\nWe  now describe the dual braid monoid.  For that, we first define interval monoids.  Given a group W and a set S of generators of W as a monoid, we  define the S-length l_S(w) as the minimum number of elements of S needed  to write w. We  then define left-divisors  of x as the d such that  there exists y with x=dy  and l_S(d)+l_S(y)=l_S(x). We say that w∈ W is balanced if its set of left and right-divisors coincide; in which case  we  denote  this  set  by  [1,w],  an  \"interval\"  for the poset of S-divisibility.  We say that w  is Garside for the  S-length if it is balanced  and [1,w] is a  lattice (where upper and  lower bounds are lcms and gcds), which generates W. Then we have the theorem:\n\nSuppose  w  is  Garside  for  the  S-length.  Then  the monoid M with generators  [1,w] and relations  xy=z whenever xy=z  holds in W and l_S(x)+l_S(y)=l_S(z), is a Garside monoid, with simples [1,w] and atoms S. It is called the interval monoid defined by the interval [1,w].\n\nThe  Artin-Tits braid monoid  is an interval  monoid by taking  for S the Coxeter  generators, in which case l_S  is the Coxeter length, and taking for w the longest element of W. The dual monoid, constructed by Birman, Ko  and  Lee  for  type  A  and  by Bessis for all well-generated complex reflection  groups, is obtained in  a similar way, by  taking this time for w  a Coxeter element, for l_S the reflection length 'reflength' and for S_S  the  reflections  which  divide  w  for the reflection length (for Coxeter  groups all reflections  divide w but  for well-generated complex reflection  groups not  all reflections  divide); for  the dual  monoid the simples  are of cardinality  the generalized Catalan  numbers catalan. An interval  monoid has naturally an inverse  morphism from M to W, called 'image'  which is the  quotient map from  the interval monoid  to W which sends back simple braids to [1,w].\n\nA last pertinent notion is reversible monoids. Since we store left normal forms,  it is easy to compute left lcms and gcds, but hard to compute right lcms  and gcds. But this becomes easy to  do if the monoid has an operation 'reverse',  which has the property that 'a' is a left-divisor of 'b' if and only  if 'reverse(a)'  is a  right-divisor  of 'reverse(b)'. This holds for Artin-Tits  and dual braid monoids of groups generated by true reflections; Artin-Tits monoids have a reverse operation which consists of reversing a word,  written as  a list  of atoms.  The dual  monoid also has a reverse operation  defined in the  same way, but  this operation changes monoid: it goes  from the dual monoid  for the Coxeter element  w to the dual monoid for  the Coxeter element  w⁻¹. The operations  'rightlcm' and 'rightgcd', and  some other algorithms, have faster implementations if the monoid has a reverse operation.\n\nThis  module implements also  functions to solve  the conjugacy problem and compute  centralizers  in  Garside  groups,  following  the work of Franco, Gebhardt and Gonzalez-Meneses.\n\nTwo  elements w and w' of a monoid  M are conjugate in M if there exists  x∈ M such that wx=xw'; if  M satisfies the Öre conditions, it has  a  group  of  fractions  where  this  becomes  x⁻¹wx=w',  the  usual definition  of conjugacy. A special case  which is even closer to conjugacy in  the group is if there exists y∈  M such that w=xy and w'=yx. This relation  is not transitive in general,  but we call cyclic conjugacy the transitive closure of this relation, a restricted form of conjugacy.\n\nThe  next  observation  is  that  if  w,w'  are conjugate in the group of fractions  of the Garside monoid M then  they are conjugate in M, since if wx=xw' then there is a power Δⁱ which is central and such that xΔⁱ∈ M. Then wxΔⁱ=xΔⁱ w' is a conjugation in M.\n\nThe  crucial observation for solving the  conjugacy problem is to introduce inf(w):=sup{i such that Δ⁻ⁱw∈ M} and sup(w):=inf{i such that w⁻¹Δⁱ∈ M}, and  to notice  that the  number of  conjugates of  w with same inf and sup  as w is finite (since our  monoids have a finite number of atoms). Further, a theorem of Birman shows that the maximum inf and minimum sup in a conjugacy class can be achieved simultaneously; the elements achieving this are called the super summit set of w. Thus a way to determine if two elements are conjugate is to find a representative of both of them in their super  summit set, and then solve conjugacy  within that set. This can also be  used to compute the centralizer of an element: if we consider the super summit   set  as  the  objects  of  a  category  whose  morphisms  are  the conjugations   by  simple  elements,  the   centralizer  is  given  by  the endomorphisms of the given object.\n\nWe illustrate this on an example:\n\njulia> b=B(2,1,4,1,4)\n214.14\n\njulia> c=B(1,4,1,4,3)\n14.143\n\njulia> d=conjugating_elt(b,c)\n(1)⁻¹21321432\n\njulia> b^d\n14.143\n\njulia> centralizer_gens(b)\n3-element Vector{GarsideElt{Perm{Int16}, BraidMonoid{Perm{Int16}, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}}}:\n 321432.213243\n 21.1\n 4\n\njulia> C=conjcat(b;ss=Val(:ss))\ncategory with 10 objects and 32 generating maps\n\njulia> C.obj\n10-element Vector{GarsideElt{Perm{Int16}, BraidMonoid{Perm{Int16}, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}}}:\n 1214.4\n 214.14\n 124.24\n 1343.1\n 14.124\n 143.13\n 24.214\n 134.14\n 13.134\n 14.143\n\nThere   is  a   faster  solution   to  the   conjugacy  problem   given  in gebgon10:  for each b∈ M, they define a particular simple  left-divisor of b, its preferred prefix such that the operation slide  which  cyclically  conjugates  b  by  its  preferred  prefix, is eventually periodic, and the period is contained in the super summit set of x.  We say that x  is in its sliding  circuit if some iterated slide of x is equal to x. The set of sliding circuits in a given conjugacy class is  smaller than the super  summit set, thus allows  to solve the conjugacy problem faster.

It is true (but a non-trivial theorem) that in a Coxeter group the order  of st is exactly  m(s,t), thus a Coxeter  group is the same as a Coxeter  system, that is a pair (W,S) of a group W and a set S⊂W of involutions,  such  that  the  group  is  presented  by  generators S and relations describing the order of the product of two elements of S.\n\nA   Coxeter   group   has   a   natural   representation,  its  reflection representation, on a real vector space V of dimension length(S) (which is  the  Coxeter  rank  of  W),  where  each  element  of  S  acts as a reflection;  the faithfulness of this representation (a theorem of Tits) is the main argument to prove that the order of st is exactly m(s,t). This representation  is defined as follows on a  space V with basis {eₛ} for s∈  S. The cartan  matrix associated to  the Coxeter matrix m(s,t) is the matrix C with entries C(s,t)=-2cos(π/m(s,t)); we set C(s,t)=-2 if m(s,t)=∞. Then the action of s∈ S on V is given by s(eₜ)=eₜ-C(s,t)eₛ.\n\nThus, Coxeter groups are  real reflection groups.  The converse need not be true  if the set of reflecting  hyperplanes has bad topological properties, but  it turns out  that finite Coxeter  groups are the  same as finite real reflection  groups. The possible Coxeter matrices for finite Coxeter groups have  been  completely  classified,  see  Weyl; the corresponding finite groups play a deep role in several areas of mathematics.\n\nCoxeter  groups  have  a  nice  solution  to the word problem. The length l(w)  of an element  w∈ W is  the minimum number  of elements of S of which it is a product (since the elements of S are involutions, we do not need inverses). An expression of w of minimum length is called a reduced word  for w. The main property of  reduced words is the exchange lemma which  states that if s₁…sₖ is a reduced word for w (thus k=l(w)) and s∈  S is such that l(sw)≤l(w) then one  of the sᵢ in the word for w can be deleted to obtain a reduced word for sw. Thus given s∈ S and w∈ W,  either l(sw)=l(w)+1 or l(sw)=l(w)-1 and  in the latter case we say that s belongs to the left descent set of w. Computing a reduced word for  an  element,  and  other  word  problems,  are  easy if we know how to multiply elements and know left descent sets. In each of the Coxeter groups that we implement, the left descent set is easy to compute (see for example coxeter_symmetric_group below), so this suggests how to deal with Coxeter groups generically:\n\nThe  type  CoxeterGroup  is  an  abstract  type;  an  actual struct which implements it must define a function\n\nisleftdescent(W,w,i) which tells whether the i-th element of S is in    the left descent set of w.\n\nthe other functions needed in an instance of a Coxeter group are\n\ngens(W) which returns the set S (the list of Coxeter generators)\nnref(W) which  returns the  number of  reflections of  W, if  W is  finite or nothing if W is infinite.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  a  Coxeter  group  can  be any kind of group implementing the above functions.\n\nBecause  of the  easy solution  of the  word problem  in Coxeter  groups, a convenient  way  to  represent  their  elements  is as words in the Coxeter generators,  that  is  lists  of  integers  in 1:length(S). The functions 'word'  and 'W(...)' do the conversion between Coxeter words and elements of the group.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> W=coxsym(4)\n𝔖 ₄\n\njulia> p=W(1,3,2,1,3)\n(1,4)\n\njulia> word(W,p)\n5-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 2\n 1\n\nWe  notice that the word we started with and the one that we ended up with, are  not the same, even though they  represent the same element of W. The reason  is that there are several reduced  words for an element of W. The function 'word' calculates a lexicographically smallest word for w. Below are some other possible computations using the same Coxeter group:\n\njulia> word(W,longest(W))  # the (unique) longest element in W\n6-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 3\n 2\n 1\n\njulia> w0=longest(W)\n(1,4)(2,3)\n\njulia> length(W,w0)\n6\njulia> map(w->word(W,w),refls(W,1:nref(W)))\n6-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:\n [1]\n [2]\n [3]\n [1, 2, 1]\n [2, 3, 2]\n [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\njulia> [length(elements(W,i)) for i in 0:nref(W)]\n7-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 3\n 5\n 6\n 5\n 3\n 1\n\nThe  last list tells us that there is 1 element of length 0, there are 6 of length 3, …\n\nFor  most basic functions the convention is that the input is an element of the  group, rather than a  Coxeter word. The reason  for this is that for a Coxeter  group which is a permutation  group, using the low level functions for   permutations  is   usually  much   faster  than   manipulating  lists representing reduced expressions.\n\nThe only Coxeter group constructors implemented in this module are coxsym and  coxgroup; the last constructor takes  a Cartan matrix and builds the corresponding  Coxeter group as  a matrix group.  The module Weyl defines  other methods for coxgroup building  a finite Coxeter group as a permutation group, given its type.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"coxgroups.html#Chevie.CoxGroups.isleftdescent-Tuple{CoxSym, Any, Int64}","page":"Coxeter groups","title":"Chevie.CoxGroups.isleftdescent","text":"isleftdescent(W::CoxeterGroup,w,i::Integer)\n\nreturns  true iff the  i-th generating reflection  of the Coxeter group W  is in  the left  descent set  of the  element w  of W, that is iff length(W,W(i)*w)<length(W,w).\n\njulia> W=coxsym(3)\n𝔖 ₃\n\njulia> isleftdescent(W,Perm(1,2),1)\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"coxgroups.html#Chevie.CoxGroups.isrightdescent","page":"Coxeter groups","title":"Chevie.CoxGroups.isrightdescent","text":"isrightdescent(W::CoxeterGroup,w,i::Integer)\n\nreturns  true iff the  i-th generating reflection  of the Coxeter group W  is in the  right descent set  of the element  w of W,  that is iff length(W,w*W(i))<length(W,w).\n\njulia> W=coxsym(3)\n𝔖 ₃\n\njulia> isrightdescent(W,Perm(1,2),1)\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"coxgroups.html#Chevie.CoxGroups.firstleftdescent","page":"Coxeter groups","title":"Chevie.CoxGroups.firstleftdescent","text":"firstleftdescent(W,w)\n\nreturns the index in gens(W) of the first element of the left descent set of  w –- that is, the first  i such that if s=W(i) then l(sw)<l(w).

We  want to  study the  irreducible characters  of 𝐆 ^F.  More generally we consider 𝐆 ^F where F is an isogeny of 𝐆  such  that  a  power  is  a  Frobenius  (this covers the Suzuki and Ree groups).\n\nIf  𝐓 is an F-stable  maximal torus of 𝐆, and 𝐁 is a (not necessarily  F-stable) Borel  subgroup containing  𝐓, we define the Deligne-Lusztig  variety X_𝐁=g𝐁  𝐆  𝐁  g𝐁   F(g𝐁 ) . This variety  affords  a  natural  action  of  𝐆  ^F  on  the  left,  so the corresponding   Deligne-Lusztig  virtual  module  H^*_c(X_𝐁)=ᵢ  (-1)ⁱ Hⁱ_c(X_𝐁ℚ  _ℓ)  also.  The  (virtual)  character  of this module is the Deligne-Lusztig  character  R_𝐓  ^𝐆  (1);  the  notation reflects the theorem  that this character does  not depend on the  choice of 𝐁. This character  can be  parameterized by  an F-conjugacy  class of W: if 𝐓₀𝐁₀  is an F-stable pair, there is an unique w W=N_𝐆 (𝐓₀)𝐓₀ such  that the triple (𝐓𝐁F) is 𝐆-conjugate to (𝐓₀𝐁₀wF). We will  thus denote R_w for R_𝐓^𝐆 (1); this character depends only on the F-class of w.\n\nThe  unipotent characters of 𝐆 ^F are the irreducible constituents of the  R_w. In a similar way that the Jordan decomposition shows that the unipotent classes are a building block for describing the conjugacy classes of  a  reductive  group,  Lusztig  has  defined  a  Jordan decomposition of characters  where  the  unipotent  characters  are  the building block. The unipotent  characters are parameterized by  combinatorial data that Lusztig has  defined just  from the  coset Wφ,  where φ  is the  finite order automorphism  of X(𝐓₀)  such that  F=qφ. Thus,  from our viewpoint, unipotent  characters  are  objects  combinatorially  attached to a Coxeter coset.\n\nA  subset  of  the  unipotent  characters, the principal series unipotent characters,  can  be  described  in  a  more  elementary  way. They are the constituents  of  R₁,  or  equivalently  the  characters of the virtual module  H^*_c(X_𝐁 ₀), where X_𝐁 ₀  is the discrete variety (𝐆 𝐁₀)^F;  this virtual module reduces to the actual module ℚ _ℓ(𝐆 𝐁₀) ^F.  Thus  the  Deligne-Lusztig  induction  R_𝐓₀^𝐆  (1) reduces to Harish-Chandra  induction, defined  as follows:  let 𝐏  =𝐔   𝐋  be an F-stable  Levi decomposition  of an  F-stable parabolic subgroup of 𝐆. Then the Harish-Chandra induced  R_𝐋^𝐆 of a character χ of  𝐋^F is  the character  Ind_𝐏^F^𝐆 ^Fχ,  where χ is the lift  to 𝐏^F of χ via the quotient 𝐏^F𝐔 ^F=𝐋^F; Harish-Chandra induction  is a  particular case  of Lusztig  induction, which is defined when 𝐏 is not F-stable using the variety X_𝐔 = g𝐔 𝐆 𝐔  g𝐔  F(g𝐔  ), and gives for an  𝐋^F-module a virtual 𝐆 ^F-module. Like  ordinary induction, these  functors have adjoint  functors going from representations   of   𝐆   ^F   to   representations   (resp.   virtual representations)   of  𝐋^F  called  Harish-Chandra  restriction  (resp. Lusztig restriction).\n\nThe  commuting algebra of 𝐆^F-endomorphisms of R₁=R_𝐓₀^𝐆(1) is an Iwahori-Hecke  algebra for W^φ, with parameters some powers of q; the parameters  are  all  equal  to  q  when W^φ=W. Thus principal series unipotent characters are parametrized by characters of W^φ.\n\nTo   understand  the  decomposition  of  more  general  R_w,  and  thus parameterize unipotent characters, is is useful to introduce another set of class  functions which are  parameterized by irreducible  characters of the coset  Wφ.  If  χ  is  such  a  character, we define the associated almost  character by:  Rᵪ=W¹_w Wχ(wφ)  R_w. The  name reflects that these class function are close to irreducible characters. They satisfy Rᵪ  R_ψ_𝐆^F=δ_χψ;  for  the  linear  and unitary group they are actually  unipotent characters (up to sign in the latter case). They are in general the sum (with rational coefficients) of a small number of unipotent characters in the same Lusztig family, see Families. The degree of  Rᵪ  is  a  polynomial  in  q  equal  to  the fake degree of the character χ of Wφ (see fakedegree).\n\nWe   now  describe  the  parameterization   of  unipotent  characters  when W^φ=W,  thus when the coset Wφ identifies with W (the situation is  similar  but  a  bit  more  difficult  to  describe  in  general).  The (rectangular) matrix of scalar products ρ Rᵪ_𝐆 ^F, when characters of  W  and  unipotent  characters  are  arranged in the right order, is block-diagonal   with  rather  small  blocks   which  are  called  Lusztig families.\n\nFor the characters of W  a family 𝓕 corresponds  to a block of the Hecke  algebra  over  a  ring  called  the  Rouquier ring. To 𝓕 Lusztig associates  a small group Γ (not  bigger than (ℤ2)ⁿ, or 𝔖ᵢ for i5) such that the unipotent characters in the family are parameterized by the pairs (xθ) taken up to Γ-conjugacy, where xΓ and θ is  an irreducible character of C_Γ(x).  Further, the elements of 𝓕 themselves are parameterized by a subset of such pairs, and Lusztig defines a  pairing  between  such  pairs  which  computes  the scalar product ρ Rᵪ_𝐆^F,  called  the  Lusztig  Fourier  matrix. For more details see drinfeld_double.\n\nA  second parameterization  of unipotent  character is  via Harish-Chandra series.  A character is called cuspidal if all its proper Harish-Chandra restrictions  vanish. There are few  cuspidal unipotent characters (none in GLₙ  for  n1,  and  at  most  one  in other classical groups). The 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra of an Harish-Chandra induced R_𝐋^F^𝐆^Fλ, where λ is a cuspidal unipotent character turns out to be a Hecke algebra associated to the group W_𝐆^F(𝐋^F)=N_𝐆^F(𝐋)𝐋, which turns out to be a Coxeter group. Thus another  parameterization  is  by  triples  (𝐋λφ),  where  λ is a cuspidal  unipotent  character  of  𝐋^F  and  φ  is  an irreducible character  of the  relative group  W_𝐆^F(𝐋^F). Such  characters are said to belong to the Harish-Chandra series determined by (𝐋λ).\n\nA  final  piece  of  information  attached  to  unipotent characters is the eigenvalues of Frobenius. Let Fᵟ be the smallest power of the isogeny F  which  is  a  split  Frobenius  (that  is, Fᵟ is a Frobenius and φᵟ=1). Then Fᵟ acts naturally on Deligne-Lusztig varieties and thus on  the  corresponding  virtual  modules,  and  commutes  to  the action of 𝐆^F;  thus for  a given  unipotent character  ρ, a submodule of the virtual  module which  affords ρ  affords a  single eigenvalue μ of Fᵟ. Results of Lusztig and Digne-Michel show that this eigenvalue is of the  form qᵃᵟλᵨ  where 2aℤ  and λᵨ  is a  root of  unity which depends  only on ρ and not the considered module. This λᵨ is called the  eigenvalue of Frobenius attached to ρ. Unipotent characters in the Harish-Chandra  series  of  a  pair  (𝐋λ)  have the same eigenvalue of Frobenius as λ.\n\nThis  package  contains  tables  of  all  this information, and can compute Harish-Chandra  and Lusztig  induction of  unipotent characters  and almost characters. We illustrate this on some examples:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)\nG₂\n\njulia> uc=UnipotentCharacters(W)\nUnipotentCharacters(G₂)\n┌───────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│γ      │n₀    Deg(γ)  Feg              Symbol Fr(γ)    label│\n├───────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│φ₁‚₀   │ 1         1    1       (0,0,0,0,0,2)     1         │\n│φ₁‚₆   │ 2        q⁶   q⁶ (01,01,01,01,01,12)     1         │\n│φ′₁‚₃  │ 3   qΦ₃Φ₆/3   q³            (0,0,1+)     1    (1,ρ)│\n│φ″₁‚₃  │ 4   qΦ₃Φ₆/3   q³            (0,0,1-)     1   (g₃,1)│\n│φ₂‚₁   │ 5  qΦ₂²Φ₃/6  qΦ₈       (0,0,0,0,1,1)     1    (1,1)│\n│φ₂‚₂   │ 6  qΦ₂²Φ₆/2 q²Φ₄       (0,0,0,1,0,1)     1   (g₂,1)│\n│G₂[-1] │ 7  qΦ₁²Φ₃/2    0       (01,0,01,,0,)    -1   (g₂,ε)│\n│G₂[1]  │ 8  qΦ₁²Φ₆/6    0       (01,01,0,,,0)     1    (1,ε)│\n│G₂[ζ₃] │ 9 qΦ₁²Φ₂²/3    0       (01,0,0,01,,)    ζ₃  (g₃,ζ₃)│\n│G₂[ζ₃²]│10 qΦ₁²Φ₂²/3    0       (01,01,,0,0,)   ζ₃² (g₃,ζ₃²)│\n└───────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nThe  first column gives  the name of  the unipotent character, derived from its  Harish-Chandra  classification;  the  first  6  characters  are in the principal  series  so  are  named  by  characters  of  W.

This expression is called the Lefschetz  character of the Deligne-Lusztig  variety.

A  more  complicated  formula  involving  the  eigenvalues of Frobenius  attached to  unipotent characters  applies for  m not prime to d.  The function  returns this  formula when  a second parameter m≠0 is given.\n\nThe  function 'dllefschetz' takes  as argument a  Hecke element and returns the  corresponding Lefschetz character.

We do not explain the details of this construction, but explain how its final result building Lusztig's Fourier matrix, and a variant of it that we use in Spetses, from Γ.\n\nThe  elements of the family are in bijection  with the set 𝓜 (Γ) of pairs (x,φ)  taken up to  Γ-conjugacy, where x∈Γ  and φ is an irreducible complex-valued   character  of  C_Γ(x).  To  such  a  pair  ρ=(x,φ)  is associated  an  eigenvalue  of  Frobenius  defined  by  ω_ρ=φ(x)φ(1). Lusztig  then defines a Fourier matrix S₀ whose coefficient is given, for ρ=(x,φ) and ρ'=(x', φ'), by:\n\nS₀_ρρ=C_Γ(x)¹_ρ₁=(x₁φ₁)φ₁(x)φ(y₁)\n\nwhere  the sum is over all pairs ρ₁∈𝓜 (Γ) which are Γ-conjugate to ρ' and  such that y₁ C_Γ(x). This  coefficient also represents the scalar product ρρ_𝐆^F of the corresponding unipotent characters.\n\nA  way to  understand the  formula for  S₀_ρρ better is to consider another  basis of the complex  vector space with basis  𝓜 (Γ), indexed by the  pairs  (x,y)  taken  up  to  Γ-conjugacy,  where  x  and y are commuting  elements  of  Γ.  This  basis  is  called  the basis of Mellin transforms, and given by:\n\n(xy)=_φ Irr(C_Γ(x))φ(y)(xφ)\n\nIn  the  basis  of  Mellin  transforms,  the  linear  map  S₀ is given by (x,y)↦(x⁻¹,y⁻¹)  and  the  linear  transformation  T which sends ρ to ω_ρρ   becomes  (x,y)↦(x,xy).   These  are   particular  cases  of  the permutation  representation of GL₂(ℤ)  on the basis  of Mellin transforms where beginpmatrixabcr cdendpmatrix acts by (x,y)↦(xᵃyᵇ,xᶜyᵈ).\n\nFourier  matrices in finite reductive groups  are given by the above matrix S₀.  But for non-rational Spetses, we use a different matrix S which in the  basis of Mellin transforms  is given by (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x). Equivalently, the formula S_ρρ differs from the formula for S₀_ρρ in that there  is no complex conjugation  of χ₁; thus the  matrix S is equal to S₀ multiplied on the right by the permutation matrix which corresponds to (x,φ)↦(x,φ).  The advantage of the matrix S over S₀ is that the pair S,T  satisfies directly the axioms for a fusion algebra (see below); also the matrix S is symmetric, while S₀ is Hermitian.\n\nThus there are two variants of 'drinfeld_double`:\n\ndrinfeld_double(g;lu=false)\n\nreturns  a family  containing Lusztig's  Fourier matrix  S₀, and an extra field  '.perm'  containing  the  permutation  of  the  indices  induced  by (x,φ)↦(x,φ),  which allows  to recover  S, as  well as  an extra field `:lusztig', set to 'true'.\n\ndrinfeld_double(g)\n\nreturns a family with the matrix S, which does not have fields '.lusztig' or '.perm'.\n\nThe family record 'f' returned also has the fields:\n\n:group: the group Γ.\n\n:charLabels: a list of labels describing the pairs (x,φ), and thus also specifying in which order they are taken.\n\n:fourierMat: the Fourier matrix (the matrix S or S₀ depending on the call).\n\n:eigenvalues: the eigenvalues of Frobenius.\n\n:xy: a list of pairs '[x,y]' which are representatives of the Γ-orbits of pairs of commuting elements.\n\n:mellinLabels: a list of labels describing the pairs '[x,y]'.\n\n:mellin:  the base change matrix between  the basis (x,φ) and the basis of   Mellin  transforms,   so  that   |f.fourierMat^(f.mellin^-1)|  is  the permutation  matrix (for (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x)  or (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x⁻¹) depending on the call).\n\n:special: the index of the special element, which is (x,φ)=(1,1).\n\njulia> drinfeld_double(coxsym(3)) # needs \"using GAP\"\nFamily(drinfeld_double(coxsym(3)),8)\nDrinfeld double D(coxsym(3))\n┌───────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│label  │eigen                                               │\n├───────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│(1,1)  │    1  1//6  1//3 1//6 -1//2 -1//2  1//3  1//3  1//3│\n│(1,X.2)│    1  1//3  2//3 1//3     .     . -1//3 -1//3 -1//3│\n│(1,X.3)│    1  1//6  1//3 1//6  1//2  1//2  1//3  1//3  1//3│\n│(21,1) │    1 -1//2     . 1//2  1//2 -1//2     .     .     .│\n│(21,-1)│   -1 -1//2     . 1//2 -1//2  1//2     .     .     .│\n│(3,1)  │    1  1//3 -1//3 1//3     .     .  2//3 -1//3 -1//3│\n│(3,ζ₃) │   ζ₃  1//3 -1//3 1//3     .     . -1//3 -1//3  2//3│\n│(3,ζ₃²)│  ζ₃²  1//3 -1//3 1//3     .     . -1//3  2//3 -1//3│\n└───────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\njulia> drinfeld_double(coxsym(3);lu=true)\nFamily(Ldrinfeld_double(coxsym(3)),8)\nLusztig′sDrinfeld double D(coxsym(3))\n┌───────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│label  │eigen                                               │\n├───────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│(1,1)  │    1  1//6  1//3 1//6 -1//2 -1//2  1//3  1//3  1//3│\n│(1,X.2)│    1  1//3  2//3 1//3     .     . -1//3 -1//3 -1//3│\n│(1,X.3)│    1  1//6  1//3 1//6  1//2  1//2  1//3  1//3  1//3│\n│(21,1) │    1 -1//2     . 1//2  1//2 -1//2     .     .     .│\n│(21,-1)│   -1 -1//2     . 1//2 -1//2  1//2     .     .     .│\n│(3,1)  │    1  1//3 -1//3 1//3     .     .  2//3 -1//3 -1//3│\n│(3,ζ₃) │   ζ₃  1//3 -1//3 1//3     .     . -1//3  2//3 -1//3│\n│(3,ζ₃²)│  ζ₃²  1//3 -1//3 1//3     .     . -1//3 -1//3  2//3│\n└───────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"uch.html#Chevie.Families.ndrinfeld_double","page":"Unipotent characters","title":"Chevie.Families.ndrinfeld_double","text":"ndrinfeld_double(g)\n\nThis  function returns the number of elements that the family associated to the  Drinfeld double of the group g would have, without computing it.

Let Lwϕ  be a reflection subcoset; that  is L is a  parabolic subgroup of W  (the fixator of a subspace of V)  and  w∈  W  is  such  that  wΦ  normalizes L. There are several interesting  cases where the relative group N_W(Lwϕ)L, or a subgroup of it normalizing some further data attached to L, is itself a reflection group.\n\nA first example is the case where ϕ=1 and w=1, W is the Weyl group of a   finite  reductive   group  𝐆^F   and  the   Levi  subgroup  𝐋^F corresponding  to L has a cuspidal unipotent character. Then N_W(L)L is  a  Coxeter  group  acting  on  the  space  X(Z𝐋)⊗ℝ.  A  combinatorial characterization of such parabolic subgroups of Coxeter groups is that they are  normalized by the  longest element of  larger parabolic subgroups (see 5.7.1 Lusztig1976).\n\nA  second  example  is  when  L  is  trivial  and  wϕ is a ζ-regular element,  that is  the ζ-eigenspace  V_ζ of  wϕ contains  a vector outside  all the reflecting hyperplanes of W. Then N_W(Lwϕ)L=C_W(wϕ) is a reflection group in its action on V_ζ.\n\nA similar but more general example is when V_ζ is the ζ-eigenspace of some  element of  the reflection  coset Wϕ,  and is  of maximal dimension among  such ζ-eigenspaces. Then the set of  elements of Wϕ which act by ζ  on  V_ζ  is  a  certain  subcoset  Lwϕ,  and N_W(Lwϕ)L is a reflection group in its action on V_ζ (see 2.5 Lehrer-Springer1999).\n\nFinally,  a  still  more  general  example,  but which only occurs for Weyl groups  or  Spetsial  reflection  groups,  is  when 𝐋 is a ζ-split Levi subgroup  (which means that  the corresponding subcoset  Lwϕ is formed of all  the elements which act by ζ on  some subspace V_ζ of V), and λ is  a  d-cuspidal  unipotent  character  of  𝐋  (which  means  that the multiplicity  of ζ  as a  root of  the degree  of λ  is the same as the multiplicity  of ζ as a root of the generic order of the semi-simple part of  𝐆); then N_W(Lwϕλ)L is a complex reflection group in its action on V_ζ.\n\nFurther,  in the above cases the relative group describes the decomposition of a Lusztig induction.\n\nWhen  𝐆^F is  a finite  reductive group,  and λ  a cuspidal unipotent character  of  the  Levi  subgroup  𝐋^F,  then the 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra  of  the  Harish-Chandra  induced  representation R_𝐋^𝐆(λ) is a Hecke algebra attached to the group N_W(L)L, thus the dimension of the characters  of this group describe the multiplicities in the Harish-Chandra induced.\n\nSimilarly, when 𝐋 is a ζ-split Levi subgroup, and λ is a d-cuspidal unipotent  character of  𝐋 then  (conjecturally) the 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra  of the Lusztig induced R_𝐋^𝐆(λ)  is a cyclotomic Hecke algebra for  to the  group N_W(Lwϕλ)L.  The constituents  of R_𝐋^𝐆(λ) are called  a  ζ-Harish-Chandra  series.  In  the  case of rational groups or cosets,  corresponding to finite  reductive groups, the  conjugacy class of Lwϕ  depends  only  on  the  order  d  of  ζ,  so  one  also talks of d-Harish-Chandra  series.

The particular crystallographic  root systems for Weyl groups  play an important role in mathematics as they classify semi-simple Lie algebras and algebraic groups.\n\nLet  us give precise definitions.  Let V be a  real vector space and Vⱽ its  dual. A root system is a finite set of vectors R⊂ V (the roots), together  with  a  map  r↦  rⱽ  from  R  to  a subset Rⱽ of Vⱽ (the coroots) such that:\n\nFor any r∈ R,  we have rⱽ(r)=2, so  that the formula x↦ x-rⱽ(x)r defines  a  reflection  sᵣ:V→  V  with  root  r  and coroot rⱽ.\nThe reflection sᵣ stabilizes R.\n\nThe  subgroup W=W(R) of GL(V) generated by the reflections sᵣ for r∈ R  is a finite Coxeter  group. We require reduced  root systems, that is such  that the only elements of R colinear  with r∈ R are r and -r; for Weyl groups, we also require that the root system be crystallographic, that is rⱽ(s) is an integer, for any s∈ R,rⱽ∈ Rⱽ.\n\nIf  we identify  V with  Vⱽ by  choosing a  W-invariant bilinear form (.;.),  then we have rⱽ=2r/(r;r). A root system R is irreducible if R   is  not  the  union  of  two  orthogonal  subsets;  equivalently  the representation  of W on the subspace  generated by R is irreducible. If R is reducible then the corresponding Coxeter group is the direct product of the Coxeter groups associated with the irreducible components of R.\n\nLet  us  now  describe  how  a  root  system  R and a presentation of the corresponding  W are encoded in  a Cartan matrix or  a Dynkin diagram. We can  choose a linear  form on V  which does not  vanish on any element of R.  Depending on the sign of the value of this linear form on a root r ∈ R  we call r positive or negative. Then there exists a unique subset Π  of the positive roots, the simple roots, such that any positive root is a linear combination with non-negative coefficients of the roots in Π. Any  two sets of simple roots (corresponding to different choices of linear forms) can be transformed into each other by a unique element of W(R). If S  is  the  set  of  reflections  with  respect to the simple roots, then (W,S)  is  a  Coxeter  system.  These  generating  reflections are called Coxeter generators or simple reflections.\n\nSince the pairing between V and Vⱽ is W-invariant, if Π is a set of simple  roots and if we  define the Cartan matrix  as being the n times n  matrix C={rⱽ(r')}  for r,r'∈Π,  this matrix  is independent of the chosen  linear form  up to  simultaneous permutation  of rows  and columns. Since the action of sᵣ on r' for r,r'∈Π is given by sᵣ(r')=r'-C(r,r')r,   the   Cartan   matrix   determines  the  reflection representation of W.\n\nFor  a crystallographic root system the Cartan matrix has integral entries, and  in the basis Π (completed by a basis of the orthogonal), sᵣ has an integral  matrix.  All  finite-dimensional  (complex)  representations of a finite  Coxeter  group  can  be  realized  over  the field generated by the entries of the Cartan matrix.\n\nThe  Cartan matrix is encoded  in a Dynkin diagram,  a tree with weighted edges  and  an  orientation  on  edges  of  even weight >2, as follows. The vertices are indexed by the simple reflections; an edge is drawn between s and t if the order mₛₜ of st is greater than 2 and is given the weight  mₛₜ. These  weights are  encoded by  drawing the  edge single for weight  3, double for weight 4 and triple for weight 6. The arrows indicate the relative root lengths (going from the longer to the shorter root) which may  differ between different orbits of  W on R. Alternately the Dynkin diagram  can be obtained  from the Cartan  matrix as follows:  if Cᵣₛ and Cₛᵣ  are integers  such that  |Cₛᵣ|≥|Cᵣₛ|=1 there  is an edge of weight |Cₛᵣ|  from r to s  with an arrow pointing  to s if |Cₛᵣ|>1. Note that  the Cartan matrices  we consider here  are not necessarily symmetric, contrary  to the  Cartan matrices  we considered  describing the reflection representation  of a general Coxeter  group; being symmetric corresponds to all roots being taken of the same length.\n\nThe  irreducible  crystallographic  root  systems  are  classified  by  the following  list of Dynkin diagrams. The labeling  of the nodes is the order of the generators and is shown by the function diagram.\n\nAₙ O—O—O—…—O   Bₙ O⇐ O—O—…—O  Cₙ O⇒ O—O—…—O  Dₙ O 2\n   1 2 3 … n      1  2 3 … n     1  2 3 … n     ￨\n                                              O—O—…—O\n                                              1 3 … n\n\nG₂ O⇛ O  F₄ O—O⇒O—O    E₆  O 2    E₇  O 2      E₈  O 2\n   1  2     1 2 3 4        ￨          ￨            ￨\n                       O—O—O—O—O  O—O—O—O—O—O  O—O—O—O—O—O—O\n                       1 3 4 5 6  1 3 4 5 6 7  1 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nWe get the Coxeter diagram, which describes the underlying Weyl group, if we  ignore  the  arrows:  we  see  that  the  root  systems B_n and C_n correspond to the same Coxeter group (the Coxeter diagram is defined by the Coxeter  matrix). Weyl  groups can  also be  characterized as  the finite Coxeter groups such that all off-diagonal entries of the Coxeter matrix are in {2,3,4,6}.\n\nHere  are the Coxeter diagrams for the  finite Coxeter groups which are not crystallographic (I₂(e) is not crystallographic if e∉ {2,3,4,6}).\n\n       e        5         5\nI₂(e) O—O   H₃ O—O—O  H₄ O—O—O—O\n      1 2      1 2 3     1 2 3 4\n\nThe function cartan gives the cartan matrix for an irreducible root system\n\njulia> cartan(:D,4)\n4×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n  2   0  -1   0\n  0   2  -1   0\n -1  -1   2  -1\n  0   0  -1   2\n\njulia> cartan(:I,2,5) # for type I₂(e) give e as 3rd argument\n2×2 Matrix{Cyc{Int64}}:\n       2  ζ₅²+ζ₅³\n ζ₅²+ζ₅³        2\n\nGiven   two  Cartan  matrices  c1  and  c2,  their  matrix  direct  sum (corresponding  to the  orthogonal direct  sum of  the root systems) can be obtained by cat(c1,c2,dims=[1,2]).\n\nThe  whole  root  system  can  be  recovered  from the simple roots and the corresponding  coroots, since each root  is in the orbit  of a simple root. The  restriction of the simple reflections to the span of R is determined by the Cartan matrix, so R is determined by the Cartan matrix and the set of simple roots.\n\nThe  function  rootdatum  takes  as  arguments  a  matrix r whose lines represents the list of simple roots and another matrix cr whose lines are the  corresponding  coroots  and  produces  a FiniteCoxeterGroup. Such an object  is a permutation group containing  in addition the description of a root  system. cr*transpose(r) should be a  Cartan matrix. Each element of the  coxeter  group  is  represented  as  the permutation it induces on the roots,  coded as a permutation of 1:2N  where we label the positive roots by 1:N, and the negative roots by N+1:2N.\n\nIf a single matrix argument is given to rootdatum it is taken as cr and r  is taken  to be  the identity  matrix; we  get thus  a particular root system  where the  roots are  the canonical  basis of V.

The  affine  Cartan  matrices which can be obtained  in this way  are those we  are interested in,  which give rise to affine Weyl groups.\n\nLet d=n-rank(C). A realization of a generalized Cartan matrix is a pair V,Vᵛ  of vector spaces of dimension n+d together with vectors α₁,…,αₙ∈ V  (the simple roots), αᵛ₁,…,αᵛₙ∈ Vᵛ (the simple coroots), such that (αᵛᵢ,  αⱼ)=c_{i,j}.  Up  to  isomorphism,  a  realization  is obtained as follows: write C=left(beginarraycC_1C_2endarrayright) where  C₁ is  of same  rank as  C.

If  -uₛ₀uₛ₁ has a square  root  wₛ,  we  can  scale  the  basis  Tₛ  to  get  a new basis tₛ=-Tₛ/wₛ    with   quadratic    relations   (tₛ-vₛ)(tₛ+vₛ⁻¹)=0   where vₛ=wₛ/uₛ₁.   The  most  general  case   when  Kazhdan-Lusztig  bases  and polynomials  can be defined is when the parameters vₛ belong to a totally ordered abelian group Γ for multiplication, see Lusztig1983.  We set  Γ⁺= {γ∈  Γ∣γ>0} and Γ⁻={γ⁻¹∣γ∈ Γ⁺}={γ∈ Γ∣γ<0}.\n\nThus  we assume ℋ defined over the ring ℤ[Γ], the group algebra of Γ over  ℤ, and the quadratic  relations of ℋ  associate to each s∈ S a vₛ∈  Γ⁺ such that  (tₛ-vₛ)(tₛ+vₛ⁻¹)=0. We also  set qₛ=vₛ² and define the  basis Tₛ=vₛtₛ with quadratic relations (Tₛ-qₛ)(Tₛ+1)=0; for w∈ W with reduced expression w=s₁…sₙ we define q_w Γ by q_w^½=v_s₁v_sₙ and let q_w=(q_w^½)²; we have T_w=q_w^½t_w.\n\nWe  define the bar involution on ℋ  by linearity: on ℤ[Γ] we define it by  overline_γ Γa_γγ= _γ Γ a_γ γ¹ and we extend it to ℋ by  overline T_s=T_s^-1 (equivalently overline t_s=t_s^-1). Then the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis C^_w is defined as the only basis of ℋ  stable by  the bar  involution and  congruent to  t_w modulo _w WΓt_w.\n\nThe  basis  C^_w  can  be  computed  as  follows.  We  define  elements R_xy  of ℤ[Γ] by  T_y¹=_x overlineR_xy¹ q_x¹T_x. We then  define inductively  the Kazhdan-Lusztig  polynomials (in this general context  we should say the Kazhdan-Lusztig elements of ℤ[Γ], which belong to the subalgebra of ℤ[Γ] generated by the qₛ) by P_xw=τ_(q_wq_x)^½  (_xywR_xyP_yw)  where  τ  is the truncation:  τ_nu _γ  Γ a_γγ=  _γnua_γγ; the  induction is thus on decreasing x for the Bruhat order and starts at P_ww=1. We have then C^_w=_y q_w^-12 P_ywT_y.\n\nThe  Chevie code  for the  Kazhdan-Lusztig bases  C, D, C', D', was originally  written by Andrew  Mathas around 1994,  who also contributed to the  design of bases  of Iwahori-Hecke algebras  and implemented some other bases,  such as the Murphy basis. Our code evolved from that code. The code for  the case of unequal parameters was  written around 1999 by F.Digne and J.Michel.  The Kazhdan-Lusztig  bases are  computed starting  from the C′ basis.\n\nWhen  the ℤ[Γ] is a  Laurent polynomial ring the  bar operation is taking the  inverse of  the variables,  and truncation  is keeping terms of degree smaller or equal to that of ν. It is possible to use arbitrary groups Γ as   long   as   methods   bar:_γ   Γ   a_γγ  _γ  Γ  a_γγ¹, positive_part  : _γ  Γ a_γγ  _γ 1  a_γγ and negative_part: _γ  Γ  a_γγ    _γ  1  a_γγ  have been defined on ℤ[Γ].

For Iwahori-Hecke algebras  and G(d,1,1) this module also implements  the standard T basis;  see the module KLfor Kazhdan-Lusztig bases.\n\nLet  (W,S) be  a Coxeter  system and  let mₛₜ  be the order of st for s,t∈ S. Let R be a commutative ring with 1 and for s∈ S let uₛ₀,uₛ₁∈ R be elements which depend only on the conjugacy class of s in W (this is  the  same  as  requiring  that  uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ  whenever  mₛₜ is odd). The Iwahori-Hecke   algebra  of  W  over  R  with  parameters  uₛᵢ  is  a deformation  of the group algebra of W over R defined as follows: it is the  unitary  associative  R-algebra  generated  by  elements  Tₛ, s∈ S subject to the relations:\n\n(Tₛ-uₛ₀)(Tₛ-uₛ₁)=0 for all s∈ S (the quadratic relations)\n\nTₛTₜTₛ= TₜTₛTₜ with mₛₜ factors on each side (the braid relations)\n\nIf  uₛ₀=1 and  uₛ₁=-1 for  all s  then the quadratic relations become Tₛ²=1 and the deformation of the group algebra is trivial.\n\nSince  the generators Tₛ  satisfy the braid  relations, H is  in fact a quotient  of the group algebra of the  braid group associated with W. The braid relations also imply that for any reduced expression s_1⋯ s_m of w ∈  W the product Tₛ_1⋯ Tₛ_m has the same value, that we denote T_w. We have T_1=1; if one of the uₛᵢ is invertible, the {T_w}_{w∈ W} form an R-basis  of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra  which specializes to the canonical basis of the group algebra R[W] for uₛ₀↦1 and uₛ₁↦-1.\n\nWhen  one  of  the  uₛᵢ  is  invertible,  the  structure  constants  (the decomposion  of  a  product  T_vT_w)  in  the T_w basis are obtained as follows.  Choose a reduced expression for v,  say v=s_1 ⋯ s_k and apply inductively the formula:\n\nT_sT_w=T_sw               if l(sw)=l(w)+1\n\nT_sT_w=-uₛ₀uₛ₁T_sw+(uₛ₀+uₛ₁)T_w if l(sw)=l(w)-1.\n\nIf  one of uₛ₀ or uₛ₁ is invertible  in R, for example uₛ₁, then by changing  the generators  to T′ₛ=-Tₛ/uₛ₁,  and setting qₛ=-uₛ₀/uₛ₁, the braid  relations do no change  (since when mₛₜ is  odd we have uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ) but  the quadratic relations become (T′ₛ-qₛ)(T′ₛ+1)=0. This normalisation is  the most common form considered  in the literature. Another common form in  the context of  Kazhdan-Lusztig theory, is  uₛ₀=√qₛ and uₛ₁=-√qₛ⁻¹. The  form provided, with two parameters per generator, is often useful, for instance  when constructing  the Jones  polynomial. If  for all s we have uₛ₀=q,   uₛ₁=-1   then   we   call   the   corresponding   algebra  the \"one-parameter\" or \"Spetsial\" Iwahori-Hecke algebra associated with W.\n\nFor  some  Iwahori-Hecke  algebras  the  character  table,  and  in general Kazhdan-Lusztig  bases, require  a square  root of  -uₛ₀uₛ₁. These square roots  can be specified  with the keyword  rootpara when constructing the algebra;  after  this  the  function  rootpara(H)  will return the chosen roots. If not specified, we try to extract roots automatically when needed; rootpara(H)  informs  on  the  choices  made. Note that some mathematical results  require an explicit choice of one  of the two possible roots which cannot be automatically made thus require a keyword initialisation.\n\nThere  is a universal choice  for R and uₛᵢ:  Let uₛᵢ:s∈ S,i∈[0,1] be indeterminates   such  that  uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ  whenever  mₛₜ  is  odd,  and  let A=ℤ[uₛᵢ] be the corresponding polynomial ring. Then the Hecke algebra H of  W over A with parameters uₛᵢ is called the generic Iwahori-Hecke algebra  of  W.  Any  Hecke  algebra  H₁  with parameters vₛᵢ can be obtained  by  specialization  from  H,  since  there  is  a  unique  ring homomorphism  f:A → R such that f(uₛᵢ)=vₛᵢ for all i. Then via f we can identify H₁ to R _A H.\n\nCertain invariants of the irreducible characters of the one-parameter Hecke algebra  play a special role in the representation theory of the underlying finite  Coxeter  groups,  namely  the  a-  and  A-invariants. For basic properties   of  Iwahori-Hecke   algebras  and   their  relevance   to  the representation theory of finite groups of Lie type, see for example Curtis and Reiner 1987 Sections~67 and 68.\n\nIn  the  following  example,  we  compute  the multiplication table for the 0-Iwahori–Hecke algebra associated with the Coxeter group of type A_2.\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,2)\nA₂\n\njulia> H=hecke(W,0)            # One-parameter algebra with `q=0`\nhecke(A₂,0)\n\njulia> T=Tbasis(H);            # Create the `T` basis\n\njulia> b=T.(elements(W))       # the basis\n6-element Vector{HeckeTElt{HeckeAlgebra{Int64, Perm{Int16}, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}, Int64, Perm{Int16}}}:\n T.\n T₁\n T₂\n T₁₂\n T₂₁\n T₁₂₁\n\njulia> b*permutedims(b)       # multiplication table\n6×6 Matrix{HeckeTElt{HeckeAlgebra{Int64, Perm{Int16}, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}, Int64, Perm{Int16}}}:\n T.

We will see that this also works on the level of characters and representations.\n\nFor  general complex reflection  groups, the picture  is similar. The Hecke algebras  are deformations  of the  group algebras,  generalizing those for real reflection groups.\n\nThe  definition is  as a  quotient of  the algebra  of the  braid group. We assume  now that W is  a finite reflection group  in the complex vector space  V. The braid group associated  is the fundamental group Π₁ of the  space  (V-bigcup_Hinmathcal H  H)W, where mathcal H is  the set of  reflecting hyperplanes of  W. This group  is generated by braid reflections, elements which by the natural map from the braid group to  the reflection  group project  to distinguished  reflections. The braid reflections   which  project  to  a  given  W-orbit  of  reflections  are conjugate.  Let 𝐬 be a representative of  such a conjugacy class of braid reflections,  let e  be the  order of  the image  of 𝐬  in W, and let u_𝐬0u_𝐬e-1 be indeterminates. The generic Hecke algebra of W is  the  ℤu_𝐬i^  1_𝐬i-algebra  quotient  of  the braid group algebra  by the relations (𝐬-u_𝐬0)(𝐬-u_𝐬e-1)=0, and an arbitrary Hecke  algebra for W is an algebra  obtained from this generic algebra by specializing some of the parameters.\n\nThe  generic Hecke algebras are explicitely  described by a presentation of the  braid group. The braid group can be presented by homogeneous relations in   the  braid   reflections,  called   braid  relations,  described  in Broué-Malle-Rouquier     1998     and    Bessis-Michel 2003  (some  of  which  were  obtained  using the VKCURVE GAP3-package,  also ported to Julia).  Furthermore, these presentations are such  that the  reflection group  is presented  by the same relations, plus relations  describing the order  of the generating  reflections, called the order  relations. Thus  the Hecke  algebra has  a presentation similar to that of W, with the same braid relations but the order relations replaced by a deformed version.\n\nIf  S⊂ W  is the  set of  distinguished reflections  of W which lift to generating  braid reflections in the braid  group, for each conjugacy class of  an  s  of  order  e  we take indeterminates uₛ₀,…,uₛₑ₋₁. Then the generic  Hecke algebra is the ℤuₛᵢ^1ₛᵢ-algebra H with generators T_s  for each s∈  S presented by  the braid relations  and the deformed order relations (T_s-u_s0)(T_s-u_se-1)=0.\n\nAriki,  Koike and Malle have computed the  character table of some of these algebras,  including  those  for  all  2-dimensional reflection groups, see Broué-Malle 1993 and Malle 1996; our data  has  models  of  all  representation  and  character  tables for real reflection  groups; it  contains the  same for  imprimitive groups  and for primitive groups of dimension 2 and 3 (these last representations have been computed  in Malle-Michel 2010) and contains also models and  character tables computed  by Michel for  G₂₉ and G₃₃; it contains also  partial lists of representations and partial character tables for the remaining  groups G₃₁,G₃₂  and G₃₄,  computed by  Malle and  Michel for G₃₂ and by Michel for the other two algebras.\n\nThe quotient of the Hecke algebra obtained by the specialisation u_𝐬i ζₑⁱ  is isomorphic to the group algebra of W. It was conjectured for 20 years  that over a splitting ring the Hecke algebra is itself isomorphic to the  group algebra of W over the  same ring. This was called the freeness conjecture since the main problem is to show that the Hecke algebra is free of dimension |W|. This has finally been proved in 2019 thanks to the work of  many  people  including  Marin,  Pfeiffer,  Chavli  and  Tsuchioka  for exceptional  groups. Along the way  it has been proven  that there exists a set  {b_w}_{w∈ W} of  elements of the  Braid group such  that b_1=1 and b_w maps to w by the natural quotient map, such that their images T_w form a basis of the Hecke algebra.\n\nIt  is  conjectured  that  such  a  basis  T_w  can  be  chosen such that additionnaly  the  linear  form  t  defined  by  t(T_w)=0 if w≠ 1 and t(1)=1 is a symmetrizing form for the symmetric algebra H. This is well known  for all real reflection groups  and has been proved in Malle-Mathas 1998   for   imprimitive   reflection   groups   and   in Malle-Michel 2010 for some primitive groups of dimension 2  and  3.  Chlouveraki  and  Chavli  have handled some other 2-dimensional cases.  For  each  irreducible  character  φ  of H we define the Schur element  Sᵩ associated to φ by the  condition that for any element T of  H we have t(T)=∑ᵩ φ(T)/Sᵩ. It  can be shown that the Schur elements are  Laurent polynomials, and they  do not depend on  the choice of a basis having  the  above  property.  Malle  has  computed  these  Schur elements, assuming the above conjecture; they are in the Chevie data.\n\nSee the function hecke for various ways of specifying the parameters of a Hecke   algebra.

If no parameter is given, 1 is assumed which gives the group algebra of W.\n\nThe  following forms are accepted for  parameter: if parameter is not a vector or a tuple, it is replaced by the vector fill(parameter,ngens(W)). If it is a vector with one entry, it is replaced with fill(parameter[1],ngens(W)).  If parameter  is a  vector with more than one  entry, it should  have length ngens(W),  each entry representing the parameters   for   the   corresponding   generator   of  W,  and  entries corresponding  to  the  same  W-orbit  of generators should be identical. Finally, if parameter is a Tuple, the tuple should have as many entries as  there are hyperplane  orbits in W  and each entry  will represent the parameters for the corresponding conjugacy class of braid reflections.\n\nAn  entry in  parameter for  a reflection  of order  e can  be either a single scalar value or a Vector of length 'e'. If it is a Vector, it is interpreted as the list [u₀,…,u_(e-1)] of parameters for that reflection.
