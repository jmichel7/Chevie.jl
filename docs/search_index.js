Let 𝐓 be a maximal torus of 𝐆, let X(𝐓)  be the  character group  of 𝐓  (resp. Y(𝐓)  the dual lattice of one-parameter  subgroups  of  𝐓)  and  Φ  (resp  Φ^) the roots (resp. coroots) of 𝐆 with respect to 𝐓.\n\nThen  𝐆 is  determined up  to isomorphism  by the  root datum (X(𝐓),Φ, Y(𝐓),Φ^).  In algebraic terms, this consists  in giving a free ℤ-lattice X=X(𝐓) of dimension the rank of 𝐓 (which is also called the rank of 𝐆),  and a root system Φ ⊂ X,  and giving similarly the dual roots Φ^⊂ Y=Y(𝐓).\n\nThis  is obtained  by a  slight generalization  of our  setup for a Coxeter group  W. This time we assume the canonical basis of the vector space V on  which W acts is a ℤ-basis of  X, and Φ is specified by a matrix simpleroots(W)  whose lines are the simple  roots expressed in this basis of  X. Similarly Φ^  is described by  a matrix simplecoroots(W) whose lines  are the simple coroots in the basis  of Y dual to the chosen basis of  X. The duality pairing between X and Y is the canonical one, that is   the  pairing  between  vectors   x∈  X  and  y∈   Y  is  given  by transpose(x)*y. Thus, we must have the relation simpleroots(W)*transpose(simplecoroots(W))=cartan(W).\n\nWe  get that  by a  the function  rootdatum, whose  arguments are the two matrices simpleroots(W) and simplecoroots(W) described above. The roots need  not generate V, so  the matrices need not  be square. For instance, the root datum of the linear group of rank 3 can be specified as:\n\njulia> W=rootdatum([-1 1 0;0 -1 1],[-1 1 0;0 -1 1])\nA₂Φ₁\n\njulia> reflrep(W,W(1))\n3×3 Matrix{Int64}:\n 0  1  0\n 1  0  0\n 0  0  1\n\nhere  the symmetric group on 3 letters  acts by permutation of the basis of X.  The dimension of X (size(simpleroots(W),2)) is the rank and the dimension of the subspace generated by the roots (size(simpleroots(W),1)) is  called the  semi-simple rank.  In the  example the  rank is 3 and the semisimple rank is 2.\n\nThe  default form  W=coxgroup(:A,2) defines  the adjoint  algebraic group (the  group with a trivial center). In that  case Φ is a basis of X, so simpleroots(W)  is  the  identity  matrix  and  simplecoroots(W) is the Cartan  matrix cartan(W) of the root system.\n\nThe   form  coxgroup(:A,2,sc=true)   constructs  the   semisimple  simply connected  algebraic  group,  where  simpleroots(W)  is the transposed of cartan(W) and simplecoroots(W) is the identity matrix.\n\nThere  is an extreme form  of root data which  requires another function to specify:  when W is the trivial coxgroup()  and there are thus no roots (in  this case  𝐆  is a  torus), the  root datum  has no  roots, thus is entirely  determined by  the rank  r. The  function torus(r) constructs such a root datum.\n\nFinally,  the function rootdatum also understands some familiar names for the algebraic groups and gives the results that could be obtained by giving the appropriate matrices simpleroots(W) and simplecoroots(W):\n\njulia> rootdatum(:gl,3)   # same as the previous example\ngl₃\n\nThe known types of root data are  :gl, :pgl, :sl, :slmod, :tgl :sp, :csp, :psp, :so, :pso, :cso, :halfspin,    :gpin, :spin, :E6, :E6sc, :CE6, :E7, :E7sc, :CE7, :E8, :F4, :G2.\n\nSemisimple elements\n\nIt  is possible to compute  with semi-simple elements; there  are 2 type of them.  The  first  type  are  finite  order  elements of 𝐓, which over an algebraically  closed field K are in bijection with elements of Y⊗ ℚ /ℤ whose  denominator  is  prime  to  the  characteristic  of  K.  These are represented  as a vector of Rationals r such that 0≤r<1. The function SS  constructs such  a semisimple  element from  a vector of Rationals. More  generally 𝐓 is isomorphic to (Kˣ)^n where n is the dimension of 𝐓, so a vector of elements of Kˣ is a more general representation which is   given  by  the  function   SemisimplElement;  in  this  setting  the representation given by SS is naturally interpreted as a Vector{Root1}.\n\njulia> G=rootdatum(:sl,4)\nsl₄\n\njulia> SS(G,[1//3,1//4,3//4,2//3])\nSemisimpleElement{Root1}: <ζ₃,ζ₄,ζ₄³,ζ₃²>\n\njulia> SemisimpleElement(G,[E(3),E(4),E(4,3),E(3,2)])\nSemisimpleElement{Root1}: <ζ₃,ζ₄,ζ₄³,ζ₃²>\n\njulia> L=reflection_subgroup(G,[1,3])\nA₃₍₁₃₎=A₁×A₁Φ₁\n\njulia> C=algebraic_center(L)\n(Z0 = SubTorus(A₃₍₁₃₎=A₁×A₁Φ₁,[1 2 1]), AZ = SSGroup([<1,1,-1>]), descAZ = [[1, 2]], ZD = SSGroup([<-1,1,1>,<1,1,-1>]))\n\njulia> T=torsion_subgroup(C.Z0,3)\nSSGroup([<ζ₃,ζ₃²,ζ₃>])\n\njulia> e=sort(elements(T))\n3-element Vector{SemisimpleElement{Root1}}:\n <1,1,1>\n <ζ₃,ζ₃²,ζ₃>\n <ζ₃²,ζ₃,ζ₃²>\n\nIn  the above, the Levi subgroup  L of SL₄ consisting of block-diagonal matrices  of shape  2×2 is  constructed.

The  reason is that when a presentation is changed  (e.g. simplified)  by Tietze  transformations, new  generators and relators are introduced; thus all words in a finitely presented group would also have to be changed if such a Tietze transformation were applied to the group. Therefore, it is better to work separately with the presentation and reflect only carefully the changes on the group.\n\nIn order to speed up the algorithms, the relators in a presentation are not represented  by AbsWords, but by lists  of positive or negative generator numbers which we call Tietze words.\n\nWe  now  describe  the  available  functions;  for more information look at individual  docstrings.

For each irreducible  group the character  table is either  computed using recursive formulas  for the infinite series,  or read into the  system from a library file  for the  exceptional types.  Thus, character  tables can  be obtained quickly  even for very large groups  (e.g., E₈). Similar remarks apply for conjugacy classes.\n\nThe  conjugacy  classes  and  irreducible  characters of irreducible finite complex reflection groups have canonical labelings by certain combinatorial objects;  these labelings are used in the  tables we give. For the classes, these  are partitions or partition tuples  for the infinite series, or, for exceptional  Coxeter  groups,  Carter's  admissible  diagrams Carter1972; for other  primitive  complex  reflection  groups  we  just  use  words  in the generators  to specify  the classes.

This information is given by the functions classinfo  and  charinfo.  When  you  display  the character table, the canonical labelings for classes and characters are displayed.\n\nA  typical example  is coxgroup(:A,n),  the symmetric  group 𝔖ₙ₊₁ where classes  and characters are  parameterized by partitions  of n+1 (this is also the case for CoxSym(n+1)).\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,3)\nA₃\n\njulia> CharTable(W)\nCharTable(A₃)\n    │1111 211 22 31  4\n────┼──────────────────\n1111│   1  -1  1  1 -1\n211 │   3  -1 -1  .  1\n22  │   2   .  2 -1  .\n31  │   3   1 -1  . -1\n4   │   1   1  1  1  1\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)\nG₂\n\njulia> ct=CharTable(W)\nCharTable(G₂)\n     │A₀ Ã₁ A₁ G₂ A₂ A₁+Ã₁\n─────┼─────────────────────\nφ₁‚₀ │ 1  1  1  1  1     1\nφ₁‚₆ │ 1 -1 -1  1  1     1\nφ′₁‚₃│ 1  1 -1 -1  1    -1\nφ″₁‚₃│ 1 -1  1 -1  1    -1\nφ₂‚₁ │ 2  .  .  1 -1    -2\nφ₂‚₂ │ 2  .  . -1 -1     2\n\njulia> ct.charnames\n6-element Vector{String}:\n \"\\phi_{1,0}\"\n \"\\phi_{1,6}\"\n \"\\phi_{1,3}'\"\n \"\\phi_{1,3}''\"\n \"\\phi_{2,1}\"\n \"\\phi_{2,2}\"\n\njulia> ct.classnames\n6-element Vector{String}:\n \"A_0\"\n \"\\tilde A_1\"\n \"A_1\"\n \"G_2\"\n \"A_2\"\n \"A_1+\\tilde A_1\"\n\nReflection  groups  have  fake  degrees  (see fakedegrees), whose valuation and degree give two integers b,B for each irreducible character of  W. For  spetsial groups  (which include  finite Coxeter  groups), the valuation  and degree of the generic degrees  of the Hecke algebra give two more integers a,A (for Coxeter groups see Carter1985, Ch.11 for more details). These integers are also used in the  operations of  truncated induction,  see jInductionTable and JInductionTable.\n\nIwahori-Hecke  algebras and  cyclotomic Hecke  algebras also have character tables, see the corresponding chapters.\n\nWe  now describe for each type our conventions for labeling the classes and characters.\n\nType  Aₙ  (n≥0).  In  this  case  we  have  W ≅ 𝔖ₙ₊₁. The classes and characters  are labeled by partitions of n+1. The partition corresponding to  a class describes  the cycle type  for the elements  in that class; the representative   in  '.classtext'   is  the   concatenation  of  the  words corresponding  to each part, and to a part i is associated the product of i-1  consecutive generators (starting one  higher that the last generator used  for the previous  parts). The partition  corresponding to a character describes  the type of  the Young subgroup  such that the trivial character induced  from this subgroup  contains that character  with multiplicity 1 and such that every other character occurring in this induced character has a  higher a-value. Thus, the sign  character corresponds to the partition (1ⁿ⁺¹)  and the trivial character to the partition (n+1). The character of the reflection representation of W is labeled by (n,1).\n\nType  Bₙ  (n≥2).  In  this  case  W=W(Bₙ) is isomorphic to the wreath product  of the cyclic  group of order  2 with the  symmetric group 𝔖ₙ. Hence  the classes and characters are  parameterized by pairs of partitions such  that the total sum of their  parts equals n. The pair corresponding to  a class describes the signed cycle type for the elements in that class, as in Carter1972. We use the convention that if (λ,μ) is such a pair then λ corresponds to the positive and μ to the negative cycles.  Thus, (1ⁿ,-) and (-,1ⁿ) label  the trivial class and the class containing  the longest element, respectively. The pair corresponding to an irreducible character is determined via Clifford theory, as follows.\n\nWe  have a semidirect product decomposition W(Bₙ)=N ⋊ 𝔖ₙ where N is the standard  n-dimensional  𝔽₂ⁿ-vector  space.  For  a,b  ≥  0 such that n=a+b let η_{a,b} be the irreducible character of N which takes value 1  on the first a standard basis vectors and value -1 on the next b standard  basis vectors of N. Then  the inertia subgroup of η_{a,b} has the  form T_{a,b}=N.(𝔖_a × 𝔖_b) and  we can extend η_{a,b} trivially to an  irreducible  character  η̃_{a,b}  of  T_{a,b}.  Let  α and β be partitions  of a and b, respectively. We take the tensor product of the corresponding  irreducible characters of 𝔖_a and 𝔖_b and regard this as an  irreducible  character  of  T_{a,b}.  Multiplying this character with η̃_{a,b}  and  inducing  to  W(Bₙ)  yields an irreducible character χ= χ_{(α,β)}  of W(Bₙ). This defines the correspondence between irreducible characters and pairs of partitions as above.\n\nFor example, the pair ((n),-) labels the trivial character and (-,(1ⁿ)) labels  the  sign  character.  The  character  of  the  natural  reflection representation is labeled by ((n-1),(1)).\n\nType  Dₙ (n≥4). In this case W=W(Dₙ) can be embedded as a subgroup of index  2 into the Coxeter  group W(Bₙ). The intersection  of a class of W(Bₙ) with W(Dₙ) is either empty or a single class in W(Dₙ) or splits up  into two classes in  W(Dₙ). This also leads  to a parameterization of the  classes of W(Dₙ) by pairs of  partitions (λ,μ) as before but where the  number of parts of μ is even and where there are two classes of this type  if μ is empty and all parts of  λ are even. In the latter case we denote  the two classes in W(Dₙ) by (λ,+) and (λ,-), where we use the convention  that  the  class  labeled  by (λ,+) contains a representative which  can be written  as a word  in {s₁,s₃,…,sₙ} and  (λ,-) contains a representative which can be written as a word in {s₂,s₃, …,sₙ}.\n\nBy  Clifford theory the restriction of  an irreducible character of W(Bₙ) to  W(Dₙ)  is  either  irreducible  or  splits  up  into  two irreducible components.  Let (α,β) be  a pair of  partitions with total  sum of parts equal to n. If α!=β then the restrictions of the irreducible characters of  W(Bₙ) labeled  by (α,β)  and (β,α)  are irreducible and equal. If α=β  then the restriction of the character labeled by (α,α) splits into two  irreducible components  which we  denote by  (α,+) and (α,-). Note that  this can only happen if n is  even. In order to fix the notation we use  a  result  of  Stembridge1989  which describes the value  of the  difference of  these two  characters on  a class of the form (λ,+)  in terms of the character values of the symmetric group 𝔖_{n/2}. Recall  that it is implicit  in the notation (λ,+)  that all parts of λ are even. Let λ' be the partition of n/2 obtained by dividing each part by  2. Then the value of χ_{(α,-)}-χ_{(α,+)} on an element in the class (λ,+) is given by 2^{k(λ)} times the value of the irreducible character of  𝔖_{n/2} labeled by α on the class of cycle type λ'. (Here, k(λ) denotes the number of non-zero parts of λ.)\n\nThe  labels for the trivial, the  sign and the natural reflection character are the same as for W(Bₙ), since these characters are restrictions of the corresponding characters of W(Bₙ).\n\nThe groups G(d,1,n). They  are isomorphic to the wreath product of the cyclic group of order d with  the  symmetric  group  𝔖ₙ.  Hence  the  classes  and characters are parameterized  by d-tuples of partitions such that the total sum of their parts  equals n. The words chosen  as representatives of the classes are, when d>2, computed in a slightly different way than for Bₙ, in order to agree  with the words on which Ram  and Halverson compute the characters of the  Hecke algebra. First the parts of the d partitions are merged in one big  partition and sorted in  increasing order. Then, to  a part i coming from  the j-th partition is  associated the word (l+1…1… l+1)ʲ⁻¹l+2…l+i where l is the highest generator used to express the previous part.\n\nThe  d-tuple corresponding to an  irreducible character is determined via Clifford  theory in  a similar  way than  for the  Bₙ case.  The identity character  has the first  partition with one  part equal n  and the other ones  empty. The character of the  reflection representations has the first two  partitions with one part  equal respectively to n-1  and to 1, and the other partitions empty.\n\nThe groups G(de,e,n). They  are normal  subgroups of  index e  in G(de,1,n).  The quotient is cyclic,  generated by the image g  of the first generator of G(de,1,n). The  classes are parameterized as the  classes of G(de,e,n) with an extra information for a component of a class which splits.\n\nAccording  to  Hugues1985,  a  class  C of G(de,1,n) parameterized  by a de-partition (S₀S_de-1) is in G(de,e,n) if e  divides ᵢ i _p Sᵢp. It  splits in d classes for the largest d  dividing e and all parts of all  Sᵢ and such that Sᵢ is empty if d  does not divide i. If w is in C then 'gⁱ w g⁻ⁱ' for 'i in 0:d-1' are  representatives of the classes of G(de,e,n) which meet C. They are described by appending the integer i to the label for C.\n\nThe  characters are described by Clifford theory. We make g act on labels for  characters of G(de,1,n)  . The action  of g permutes circularly by d  the partitions in the de-tuple.  A character has same restriction to G(de,e,n)  as its transform by g.  The number of irreducible components of its restriction is equal to the order k of its stabilizer under powers of  g.  We  encode  a  character  of  G(de,e,n)  by first, choosing the smallest  for lexicographical order label  of a character whose restriction contains  it; then this label is periodic with a motive repeated k times; we  represent the  character by  one of  these motives,  to which we append E(k)ⁱ for 'i in 0:k-1' to describe which component of the restriction we choose.\n\nTypes G₂ and F₄. The matrices of character values and the orderings and labelings  of  the  irreducible  characters  are  exactly  the  same  as in Carter1985,  p.412/413:  in  type  G₂  the  character φ₁,₃'  takes the value -1 on the reflection associated to the long simple root;  in type F₄, the characters φ₁,₁₂', φ₂,₄', φ₄,₇', φ₈,₉' and φ₉,₆' occur in the induced of the identity from the A₂ corresponding to the  short  simple  roots;  the  pairs  (φ₂,₁₆',  φ₂,₄″)  and (φ₈,₃', φ₈,₉″)  are  related  by  tensoring  by  sign; and finally φ₆,₆″ is the exterior  square of the  reflection representation. Note,  however, that we put  the long root at  the left of the  Dynkin diagrams to be in accordance with the conventions in Lusztig1985, (4.8) and (4.10).\n\nThe classes are labeled by Carter's admissible diagrams Carter1972.  A character  is labeled  by a pair (d,b) where  d denotes the  degree and b  the corresponding b-invariant. If there  are several characters with the same  pair (d,b) we attach a prime to them, as in Carter1985.\n\nTypes  E₆,E₇,E₈. The character  tables are obtained  by specialization of those  of the Hecke algebra. The classes are labeled by Carter's admissible diagrams Carter1972. A character is labeled by the pair (d,b)  where  d  denotes  the  degree  and  b  is  the  corresponding b-invariant.  For  these  types,  this  gives  a  unique  labeling of the characters.\n\nNon-crystallographic  types I₂(m), H₃, H₄. In these cases we do not have  canonical  labelings  for  the  classes.  We  label  them  by reduced expressions.\n\nEach  character for  type H₃  is uniquely  determined by the pair (d,b) where  d is the degree and  b the corresponding b-invariant. For type H₄  there are just  two characters (those  of degree 30)  for which the corresponding  pairs are  the same.  These two  characters are nevertheless distinguished  by  their  fake  degrees:  the  character φ₃₀,₁₀' has fake degree  q¹⁰+q¹²+ higher terms, while φ₃₀,₁₀″ has fake degree q¹⁰+q¹⁴+ higher  terms. The characters in the table for type H₄ are ordered in the same way as in Alvis and Lusztig1982.\n\nFinally,  the characters  of degree 2  for type  I₂(m) are  ordered as follows.  The matrix representations affording the characters of degree 2 are given by: ρ_j  s₁s₂  beginpmatrixE(m)^j00E(m)^-jendpmatrix  s₁beginpmatrix0110endpmatrix where  1 ≤ j ≤  ⌊(m-1)/2⌋. The reflection representation is  ρ₁. The  characters in  the table  are ordered by listing first the characters of degree 1 and then ρ₁,ρ₂,….\n\nPrimitive complex reflection groups G₄ to G₃₄. The  groups G₂₃=H₃, G₂₈=F₄, G₃₀=H₄ are exceptional Coxeter groups and have  been  explained  above.  Similarly  for  the  other groups labels for characters  consist primarily  of the  pair (d,b)  where d  denotes the degree  and b is the corresponding  b-invariant. This is sufficient for G₄,  G₁₂, G₂₂ and G₂₄. For other  groups there are pairs or triples of  characters which  have the  same (d,b)  value. We  disambiguate these according  to  the  conventions  of Malle2000 for G₂₇, G₂₉, G₃₁, G₃₃ and G₃₄:\n\nFor G₂₇:\n\nThe  fake degree  of φ₃,₅'  (resp. φ₃,₂₀',  φ₈,₉″) has smaller degree that  of  φ₃,₅″  (resp.  φ₃,₂₀″,  φ₈,₉'). The characters φ₅,₁₅' and φ₅,₆' occur with multiplicity 1 in the induced from the trivial character of  the parabolic subgroup  of type A₂  generated by the  first and third generator  (it is asserted mistakenly in Malle2000 that φ₅,₆″ does not occur in this induced; it occurs with multiplicity 2).\n\nFor G₂₉:\n\nThe  character  φ₆,₁₀‴  is  the  exterior  square  of φ₄,₁; its complex conjugate  is φ₆,₁₀⁗. The  character φ₁₅,₄″ occurs  in φ₄,₁⊗φ₄,₃; the character  φ₁₅,₁₂″  is  tensored  by  the  sign  character from φ₁₅,₄″. Finally  φ₆,₁₀' occurs in  the induced from  the trivial character of the standard parabolic subgroup of type A₃ generated by the first, second and fourth generators.\n\nFor G₃₁:\n\nThe  characters φ₁₅,₈', φ₁₅,₂₀' and φ₄₅,₈″ occur in φ₄,₁⊗φ₂₀,₇; the character   φ₂₀,₁₃'  is  complex  conjugate  of  φ₂₀,₇;  the  character φ₄₅,₁₂'  is tensored by sign of φ₄₅,₈'. The two terms of maximal degree of  the fakedegree of φ₃₀,₁₀' are  q⁵⁰+q⁴⁶ while for φ₃₀,₁₀″ they are q⁵⁰+2q⁴⁶.\n\nFor G₃₃:\n\nThe  terms of  maximal degree  of the  fakedegree of φ₁₀,₈' are q²⁸+q²⁶ while  for φ₁₀,₈' they are q²⁸+q²⁴. The  terms of maximal degree of the fakedegree   of  φ₄₀,₅'  are  q³¹+q²⁹   while  for  φ₄₀,₅″  they  are q³¹+2q²⁹.  The character  φ₁₀,₁₇' is  tensored by  sign of φ₁₀,₈' and φ₄₀,₁₄' is tensored by sign of φ₄₀,₅'.\n\nFor G₃₄:\n\nThe  character φ₂₀,₃₃' occurs in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₅,₁₄. The character φ₇₀,₉' is rational.  The character  φ₇₀,₉″ occurs  in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₅,₁₄.  The character φ₇₀,₄₅'   is  rational.The   character  φ₇₀,₄₅″   is  tensored  by  the determinant  character of  φ₇₀,₉″. The  character φ₅₆₀,₁₈' is rational. The character φ₅₆₀,₁₈‴ occurs in φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇. The character φ₂₈₀,₁₂' occurs    in   φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇.   The   character   φ₂₈₀,₃₀″   occurs   in φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇.  The  character  φ₅₄₀,₂₁'  occurs  in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₀₅,₂₀. The character  φ₁₀₅,₈' is  complex conjugate  of φ₁₀₅,₄,  and φ₈₄₀,₁₃' is complex  conjugate  of  φ₈₄₀,₁₁.  The  character  φ₈₄₀,₂₃'  is  complex conjugate  of  φ₈₄₀,₁₉.  Finally  φ₁₂₀,₂₁'  occurs  in induced from the trivial character of the standard parabolic subgroup of type A₅ generated by the generators of G₃₄ with the third one omitted.\n\nFor  the groups G₅ and G₇ we  adopt the following conventions. For G₅ they are compatible with those of MalleRouquier2003 and BroueMalleMichel2014.\n\nFor G₅:\n\nWe  let W=complex_reflection_group(5),  so the  generators are  W(1) and W(2).\n\nThe  character φ₁,₄' (resp. φ₁,₁₂', φ₂,₃') takes the value 1 (resp. ζ₃,  -ζ₃)  on  W(1).  The  character  φ₁,₈″ is complex conjugate to φ₁,₁₆,  and the character  φ₁,₈' is complex  conjugate to φ₁,₄' . The character  φ₂,₅″ is complex  conjugate to φ₂,₁;  φ₂,₅' take the value -1 on W(1). The character φ₂,₇' is complex conjugate to φ₂,₅'.\n\nFor G₇:\n\nWe  let W=complex_reflection_group(7),  so the  generators are W(1), W(2) and W(3).\n\nThe  characters  φ₁,₄'  and  φ₁,₁₀'  take  the value 1 on W(2). The character  φ₁,₈″ is complex  conjugate to φ₁,₁₆  and φ₁,₈' is complex conjugate  to φ₁,₄'. The characters φ₁,₁₂'  and φ₁,₁₈' take the value ζ₃  on W(2). The character φ₁,₁₄″ is complex conjugate to φ₁,₂₂ and φ₁,₁₄'  is complex conjugate to φ₁,₁₀'. The character φ₂,₃' takes the value  -ζ₃ on  W(2) and  φ₂,₁₃' takes  the value  -1 on W(2). The characters  φ₂,₁₁″, φ₂,₅″, φ₂,₇‴ and  φ₂,₁ are Galois conjugate, as well  as  the  characters  φ₂,₇',  φ₂,₁₃',  φ₂,₁₁'  and  φ₂,₅'. The character  φ₂,₉' is complex  conjugate to φ₂,₁₅  and φ₂,₉‴ is complex conjugate to φ₂,₃'.\n\nFinally,  for the remaining groups G₆, G₈  to G₁₁, G₁₃ to G₂₁, G₂₅, G₂₆,  G₃₂ and G₃₃ there are only  pairs of characters with same value (d,b).  We give labels uniformly to these characters by applying in order the following rules :\n\nIf the two characters have  different fake degrees, label φ_{d,b}' the  one  whose  fake  degree  is  minimal  for  the  lexicographic  order of  polynomials (starting with the highest term).\nFor the not yet labeled pairs, if only one of the two characters has the  property   that  in  its   Galois  orbit  at   least  one  character  is  distinguished by its (d,b)-invariant, label it φ_{d,b}'.\nFor the not yet labeled pairs,  if the minimum of the (d,b)-value (for  the  lexicographic  order  (d,b))  in  the  Galois  orbits  of the two  character  is different, label φ_{d,b}' the character with the minimal  minimum.\nWe define now a new invariant  for characters: consider all the pairs of  irreducible   characters  χ  and  ψ  uniquely  determined  by  their  (d,b)-invariant such that φ occurs with non-zero multiplicity m in  χ⊗ψ.  We define  t(φ) to  be the  minimal (for  lexicographic order)  possible list (d(χ),b(χ),d(ψ),b(ψ),m).\n\nFor  the not  yet labeled  pairs, if  the t-invariants are different, label φ_{d,b}' the character with the minimal t-invariant.\n\nAfter  applying  the  last  rule  all  the  pairs  will be labelled for the considered  groups. The labelling obtained  is compatible for G₂₅, G₂₆, G₃₂  and G₃₃  with that  of Malle2000  and for G₈ with that described in MalleRouquier2003.\n\nWe  should  emphasize  that  for  all  groups  with  a  few exceptions, the parameters  for characters do  not depend on  any non-canonical choice. The exceptions  are G(de,e,n) with e>1, and G₅, G₇, G₂₇, G₂₈, G₂₉ and  G₃₄, groups  which admit  outer automorphisms  preserving the set of reflections,  so choices  of a  particular value  on a particular generator must be made for characters which are not invariant by these automorphisms.\n\nLabels  for the classes. For the exceptional complex reflection groups, the labels  for the classes represent the  decomposition of a representative of the  class as a product of generators, with the additional conventions that 'z'  represents the generator  of the center  and for well-generated groups 'c'  represents a Coxeter element  (a product of the  generators which is a regular element for the highest reflection degree).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"chars.html#Gapjm.Chars.CharTable","page":"Classes/characters of reflection groups","title":"Gapjm.Chars.CharTable","text":"CharTable is a structure to hold character tables of groups and Hecke  algebras\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"chars.html#Gapjm.Chars.on_chars","page":"Classes/characters of reflection groups","title":"Gapjm.Chars.on_chars","text":"on_chars(G,aut)\n\naut  is an automorphism of  the group G (for  a permutation group, this could  be  given  as  a  permutation  normalizing  G).

Let r∈ V be an  eigenvector of s for the eigenvalue ζₛ (a root) and let rᵛ be a linear  form  on  V  of  kernel  Hₛ  (a  coroot). If r and rᵛ are normalized  such that rᵛ(r)=1-ζ,  then s is  the map on  V defined by s(x)=x-rᵛ(x)r.  Such a root and  coroot for s are  unique up to scaling the root and inversely scaling the coroot.\n\nA  finite  complex  reflection  group  W  is  a finite group generated by complex  reflections. Since when W contains  a reflection s it contains its powers, W is always generated by reflections s such that ζₛ==E(d) where  d is the order of s; we may in addition assume that s is not a power  of another  reflection with  larger order  d. Such a reflection is called  a distinguished reflection of W; it is a canonical generator of the cyclic subgroup of W centralizing Hₛ. The generators of the complex reflection  groups we construct are  always distinguished reflections; in a real  reflection group all reflections are distinguished. Note that the set of   distinguished  reflections  are  in   bijection  with  the  reflecting hyperplanes.\n\nIt  is much  more efficient  to compute  with permutation  groups than with matrix groups, when possible; thus the efficient representation that we use for  computing with a finite complex reflection group W, is a permutation representation  on  a  W-invariant  set  of  root  and coroot vectors for reflections of W; that is, a set R of pairs (r,rᵛ)∈ V×Vᵛ invariant by W  and such that each distinguished reflection  in W is defined by some pair  in R (see reflection). Trying to find a W-invariant set implies  that there may be several  pairs for each reflection, differing by roots  of unity. This generalizes the usual construction for Coxeter groups (the  case K=ℝ) where to each reflection of W is associated two roots, a  positive and a negative one.  For irreducible complex reflection groups, there are at least as many roots on a given line as the order of the center of W.\n\nFor these groups the following methods are defined:\n\ngens(W): the (distinguished) reflections which generate W, given as permutations of the roots. reflrep(W) will give them as matrices.\n\nroots(W): the list of roots of W.\n\ncoroots(W): the list of coroots, in the same order as the roots.\n\nrefls(W):  the list of distinguished reflections of W, as permutations, which  starts with  gens(W). Actually  this list  is of  same length as the roots,  and  its  i-th  element  is  the distinguished reflection for the i-th  root, so it will have repetitions. reflections(W) gives a list of all   reflections  of  W  (nor  only  the  distinguished  ones),  without repetitions, as objects of type Reflection containing more information on each reflection.\n\nThe  finite  irreducible  complex  reflection  groups  have been completely classified  by  Shepard  and  Todd.  They  consist  of  one infinite family G(de,e,r) depending on 3 parameters, and 34 exceptional groups which have been given by Shephard and Todd names which range from G₄ to G₃₇. These exceptional   groups   contain   the   exceptional  Coxeter  groups,  e.g., coxgroup(:E,8) is the same as G₃₇.\n\nWe provide functions to build any finite reflection group, either by giving a  list  of  roots  and  coroots  defining  the generating reflections (see PRG), or in terms of the classification (see complex_reflection_group).  In the  context e.g.  of Weyl groups, one  wants to  describe the  particular root  system chosen  in term of the traditional  classification of crystallographic root  systems. This is done via   calls  to  the  function   coxeter_group  (see  the  module Weyl).  There is not yet  a general theory on  how to construct a nice  set of roots for  a non-real reflection group;  the roots chosen here where  obtained  case-by-case;  however,  they  satisfy  several  important properties:\n\nThe generating reflections  satisfy braid relations  which present the braid group associated to W (see diagram).\nThe field  of definition  of W  is the  field K generated by the traces  of the elements of W acting on  V. It is a theorem that W may be realized as a reflection group over K.\n\njulia> W=complex_reflection_group(4)\nG₄\n\njulia> gens(W) # as a permutation of the 24 roots\n2-element Vector{Perm{Int16}}:\n (1,3,9)(2,4,7)(5,10,18)(6,11,16)(8,12,19)(13,15,20)(14,17,21)(22,23,24)\n (1,5,13)(2,6,10)(3,7,14)(4,8,15)(9,16,22)(11,12,17)(18,19,23)(20,21,24)\n\njulia> length(unique(refls(W)))\n4\n\njulia> length(refls(W)) # 24=4*(number of roots of unity in ℚ (ζ₃))\n24\n\njulia> reflrep(W) # the reflection representations\n2-element Vector{Matrix{Cyc{Rational{Int64}}}}:\n [1 0; 0 ζ₃]\n [√-3/3 -ζ₃²√-3/3; (-3+√-3)/3 -ζ₃√-3/3]\n\njulia> braid_relations(W) # the braid relation between generators\n1-element Vector{Vector{Vector{Int64}}}:\n [[1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2]]\n\njulia> diagram(W) # the same in pictures\n③ ——③ G₄\n1   2\n\nFor  almost  all  irreducible  complex  reflection  groups,  the generating matrices  for W we give have coefficients in the field of definition K. Further,  the set of matrices for all elements of W is globally invariant under  the  Galois  group  of  K/ℚ,  thus  the  Galois  action  induces automorphisms  of W. The exceptions are G₂₂, G₂₇ where the matrices are in  a  degree  two  extension  of  K  (this  is needed to have a globally invariant  model, see MarinMichel2010) and some dihedral  groups, as well as  H₃ and H₄, where  the matrices given (the usual   Coxeter  reflection  representation  over  K)  are  not  globally invariant (but one can get invariant ones by chevieget(:H4,:InvariantModel)).\n\nIt  turns out that all representations of W are defined over the field of definition K (see. Benard1976 and D.~Bessis' thesis). This  has been known for a  long time in the case  K=ℚ, the case of Weyl groups, whose representations are all integral.\n\nThe Cartan matrix (see cartan) for the generating roots (those  which  correspond to the generating reflections) has entries in the ring  ℤₖ  of  integers  of  K,  and  the  roots (resp. coroots) are linear  combination  with coefficients in ℤₖ  of a linearly independent subset  of them.\n\nSome additional methods for finite reflection groups:\n\nsimpleroots(W):  the generating roots as a matrix.\n\nsimplecoroots(W):  the generating coroots as a matrix.\n\njulia> cartan(W)\n2×2 Matrix{Cyc{Rational{Int64}}}:\n ζ₃²√-3     ζ₃²\n   -ζ₃²  ζ₃²√-3\n\njulia> simpleroots(W)\n2×2 Matrix{Cyc{Rational{Int64}}}:\n    0  ζ₃²√-3\n 2ζ₃²     ζ₃²\n\njulia> simplecoroots(W)\n2×2 Matrix{Cyc{Rational{Int64}}}:\n     0      1\n √-3/3  √-3/3\n\nLet SV be the symmetric algebra of V. The invariants of W in SV are called  the  polynomial  invariants  of  W.  They  are  generated  as a polynomial   ring   by   dim   V  homogeneous  algebraically  independent polynomials  f₁,…,f_{dim  V}.  The  polynomials  fᵢ  are  not  uniquely determined   but  their  degrees  are.  The  fᵢ  are  called  the  basic invariants  of W, and their degrees the reflection degrees of W; the function degrees(W) returns these invariants.\n\nLet  I be the  ideal generated by  the homogeneous invariants of positive degree  in SV.

The unipotent  classes depend on the characteristic of k; their classification differs when the characteristic is  not good  (that is,  when it  divides one  of the coefficients of the highest  root).  In  good  characteristic,  the  unipotent  classes  are in bijection with nilpotent orbits on the Lie algebra.\n\nWe  give  the  following  information  for  a unipotent element u of each class:\n\nthe centralizer C_𝐆 (u), that we describe by the reductive part of C_𝐆  (u)^0, by the  group of components  A(u)=C_𝐆 (u)C_𝐆 (u)^0, and by the dimension of its radical.\nin good characteristic, the  Dynkin-Richardson  diagram.\nthe Springer correspondence,  attaching characters of  the Weyl group or relative Weyl groups to each character of A(u).\n\nThe  Dynkin-Richarson diagram is  attached to a  nilpotent element e of the  Lie algebra  𝔤.

It is possible to choose a system  of simple roots  Π so that  σα 0 for  αΠ, and then σα012 for any αΠ. The Dynkin diagram of Π decorated by these  values 012 is  called the Dynkin-Richardson  diagram of e, and in good characteristic is a complete invariant of its 𝔤-orbit.\n\nLet  ℬ be  the variety  of all  Borel subgroups  and let  ℬᵤ be the subvariety  of Borel subgroups  containing the unipotent  element u. Then dim C_𝐆(u)=rank 𝐆 + 2 dim ℬ_u and in good characteristic this dimension can  be computed from  the Dynkin-Richardson diagram:  the dimension of the class of u is the number of roots α such that σα01.\n\nWe   describe  now  the  Springer  correspondence.  Indecomposable  locally constant  𝐆-equivariant sheaves  on C,  called local systems, are parameterized   by  irreducible  characters  of  A(u).  The  ordinary Springer  correspondence is  a bijection  between irreducible characters of the  Weyl group and a large subset  of the local systems which contains all trivial  local  systems  (those  parameterized  by the trivial character of A(u)  for  each  u).  More  generally,  the  generalized Springer correspondence   associates  to   each  local   system  a   (unique  up  to 𝐆-conjugacy)  cuspidal pair of  a Levi subgroup  𝐋 of 𝐆 and a cuspidal  local system on an unipotent class  of 𝐋, such that the set of  local systems associated  to a given  cuspidal pair is parameterized by the characters of the relative Weyl group W_𝐆 (𝐋)=N_𝐆 (𝐋)𝐋. There are only few cuspidal pairs.\n\nThe  Springer correspondence gives information on the character values of a finite  reductive groups  as follows:  assume that  k is  the algebraic closure  of a finite field 𝔽_q and that F is the Frobenius attached to  an 𝔽_q-structure of  𝐆. Let C  be an F-stable unipotent class  and let u C^F; we call C the geometric class of u and the 𝐆^F-classes inside C^F are parameterized by the F-conjugacy classes  of A(u), denoted H¹(FA(u)) (most  of the time we can find u such that F acts trivially on A(u) and H¹(FA(u)) is then just the conjugacy classes). To an F-stable character φ of A(u) we  associate  the  characteristic  function  of  the corresponding local system (actually associated to an extension φ of φ to A(u)F); it  is a class function  Y_uφ on 𝐆^F which  can be normalized so that:  Y_uφ(u₁)=φ(cF) if u₁ is geometrically conjugate to u and  its 𝐆^F-class is parameterized by the F-conjugacy class cF of  A(u), otherwise Y_uφ(u₁)=0. If  the pair uφ corresponds via  the Springer correspondence to the character χ of W_𝐆(𝐋), then Y_uφ  is also  denoted Yᵪ.  There is  another important class of functions  indexed by local  systems: to a  local system on  class C is attached  an intersection cohomology complex, which is a complex of sheaves supported on the closure C. To such a complex of sheaves is associated its  characteristic  function,  a  class  function of 𝐆^F obtained by taking  the alternating trace of the Frobenius  acting on the stalks of the cohomology  sheaves. If Y_ψ  is the characteristic  function of a local system,  the  characteristic  function  of  the  corresponding intersection cohomology  complex is  denoted by  X_ψ. This  function is supported on C,  and Lusztig has shown that X_ψ=ᵩ P_ψχ Yᵪ where P_ψχ are  integer polynomials in q and  Yᵪ are attached to local systems on classes lying in C.\n\nLusztig   and  Shoji  have  given  an   algorithm  to  compute  the  matrix P_ψχ,   which  is  implemented  in  Chevie.  The  relationship  with characters   of  𝐆(𝔽_q),  taking  to  simplify  the  ordinary  Springer correspondence,  is that the  restriction to the  unipotent elements of the almost  character R_χ is equal to  q^bᵪ Xᵪ, where bᵪ is dim ℬᵤ  for an element u of  the class C such that  the support of χ is C.  The restriction of  the Deligne-Lusztig characters  R_w to the unipotents  are called  the Green  functions and  can also be computed by Chevie.  The values of  all unipotent characters  on unipotent elements can also  be  computed  in  principle  by  applying Lusztig's Fourier transform matrix (see the section on the Fourier matrix) but there is a difficulty in that  the Xᵪ must be first multiplied  by some roots of unity which are not  known in all cases (and when  known may depend on the congruence class of q modulo some small primes).\n\nWe illustrate these computations on some examples:\n\njulia> UnipotentClasses(rootdatum(:sl,4))\nUnipotentClasses(sl₄)\n1111<211<22<31<4\n   u│D-R dBu B-C          C(u) A₃(A₃₍₎=Φ₁³) A₁(A₃₍₁₃₎=A₁×A₁Φ₁)/-1 .(A₃)/ζ₄\n────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4   │222   0 222         q³.Z₄          1:4                  -1:2    ζ₄:Id\n31  │202   1 22.    q⁴.A₁₍₎=Φ₁        Id:31                               \n22  │020   2 2.2      q⁴.A₁.Z₂         2:22                 11:11         \n211 │101   3 2.. q⁵.A₂₍₁₎=A₁Φ₁       Id:211                               \n1111│000   6 ...

The partial order on unipotent  classes given by Zariski closure  is given before the table. The column   D-R,   displayed   only   in   good  characteristic,  gives  the Dynkin-Richardson  diagram  for  each  class;  the  column  dBu gives the dimension  of the variety  ℬ ᵤ. The  column B-C gives the Bala-Carter classification  of u, that is in the  case of sl₄ it displays u as  a regular unipotent in a  Levi subgroup by giving the Dynkin-Richardson diagram  of a regular  unipotent (all 2's)  at entries corresponding to the Levi  and . at  entries which do  not correspond to  the Levi. The column C(u)  describes the group  C_𝐆(u): a power  qᵈ describes that the unipotent  radical of C_𝐆(u) has  dimension d (thus qᵈ rational points);  then follows a  description of the  reductive part of the neutral component  of C_𝐆(u),  given by  the name  of its  root datum.  Then if C_𝐆(u)  is not  connected, the  description of  A(u) is given using another  vocabulary: a  cyclic group  of order  4 is  given as  Z4, and a symmetric group on 3 points would be given as S3.\n\nFor  instance, the first class 4  has C_𝐆(u)^0 unipotent of dimension 3 and A(u) equal to Z4, the cyclic group of order 4. The class 22 has  C_G(u) with unipotent radical of  dimension 4, reductive part of type  A1 and A(u) is  Z2, that is the  cyclic group of order 2. The other  classes have C_𝐆(u) connected. For  the class 31 the reductive part of C_G(u) is a torus of rank 1.\n\nThen  there is one column for each Springer series, giving for each class the  pairs  'a:b'  where  'a'  is  the  name  of  the character of A(u) describing  the local system involved and 'b'  is the name of the character of  the (relative) Weyl group corresponding by the Springer correspondence. At  the top of the  column is written the  name of the relative Weyl group, and  in brackets the  name of the  Levi affording a  cuspidal local system; next,  separated  by  a  /  is  a  description  of  the central character associated  to the  Springer series  (omitted if  this central character is trivial):   all  local  systems  in  a  given  Springer  series  have  same restriction  to the center of  𝐆. To find what  the picture becomes for another algebraic group in the same isogeny class, for instance the adjoint group,  one  simply  discards  the  Springer series whose central character becomes  trivial on the center of 𝐆;  and each group A(u) has to be quotiented  by the common  kernel of the  remaining characters. Here is the table for the adjoint group:\n\njulia> UnipotentClasses(coxgroup(:A,3))\nUnipotentClasses(A₃)\n1111<211<22<31<4\n   u│D-R dBu B-C          C(u) A₃(A₃₍₎=Φ₁³)\n────┼───────────────────────────────────────\n4   │222   0 222            q³         Id:4\n31  │202   1 22.    q⁴.A₁₍₎=Φ₁        Id:31\n22  │020   2 2.2         q⁴.A₁        Id:22\n211 │101   3 2.. q⁵.A₂₍₁₎=A₁Φ₁       Id:211\n1111│000   6 ...

If classes=true  is  given,  then  it  gives  the  values  of  the functions Q_wF on conjugacy classes.\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)\nG₂\n\njulia> GreenTable(UnipotentClasses(W))\nValues of Green functions Q_wF on local systems φ\n   Qᴵ_wF|φ│        1     A₁       Ã₁ G₂(a₁)⁽¹¹¹⁾ G₂(a₁)⁽²¹⁾ G₂(a₁) G₂\n──────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nQ_A₀^G₂   │  Φ₂²Φ₃Φ₆   Φ₂Φ₃ (2q+1)Φ₂           0          q   2q+1  1\nQ_Ã₁^G₂   │-Φ₁Φ₂Φ₃Φ₆  -Φ₁Φ₃       Φ₂           0          q      1  1\nQ_A₁^G₂   │-Φ₁Φ₂Φ₃Φ₆   Φ₂Φ₆      -Φ₁           0         -q      1  1\nQ_G₂^G₂   │ Φ₁²Φ₂²Φ₃ -Φ₁Φ₂²    -Φ₁Φ₂           0         -q     Φ₂  1\nQ_A₂^G₂   │ Φ₁²Φ₂²Φ₆  Φ₁²Φ₂    -Φ₁Φ₂           0          q    -Φ₁  1\nQ_A₁+Ã₁^G₂│  Φ₁²Φ₃Φ₆  -Φ₁Φ₆ (2q-1)Φ₁           0         -q  -2q+1  1\nQ_^.      │        0      0        0          q²          0      0  0\n\nThe  functions Q_wF depend only on the conjugacy class of wF, so in the  first column the indices of 'Q' are the names of the conjugacy classes of W_𝐆(𝐋).

We say that F₀∈ GL(V)  is an  automorphism of  R if  it permutes  R and is of finite order  (finite  order  is  automatic  if  R generates V). It follows by chap.  VI,  §1.1,  lemme  1  Bourbaki1968 that the dual F₀*∈  GL(V*)  permutes  the  coroots  R*⊂  V*; thus F₀ normalizes the reflection  group  W  associated  to  R,  that  is  w↦  F₀wF₀⁻¹ is an automorphism  of W. Thus we get a reflection coset WF₀, which we call a Coxeter coset.\n\nThe  motivation for introducing Coxeter  cosets comes from automorphisms of algebraic  reductive groups, giving rise to non-split reductive groups over finite fields. Let 𝐆 be a connected reductive algebraic group 𝐆 over an algebraic  closure 𝔽̄_q of a finite field 𝔽_q, defined over 𝔽_q; this corresponds  to a  Frobenius endomorphism  F so  that the finite group of rational  points 𝐆(𝔽_q) identifies to the  subgroup 𝐆^F of fixed points under F.\n\nLet 𝐓 be a maximal torus of 𝐆, and Φ (resp. Φ*) be the roots (resp. coroots)  of 𝐆 with respect  to 𝐓 in the  character group X(𝐓) (resp. the  group of one-parameter subgroups Y(𝐓)). Then 𝐆 is determined up to isomorphism  by (X(𝐓),Φ,Y(𝐓),Φ*); this corresponds  to give a root system in   the  vector  space  V=ℚ ⊗ X(𝐓)   and  a  rational  reflection  group W=N_𝐆(𝐓)/𝐓 acting on it.\n\nIf  𝐓 is F-stable the Frobenius endomorphism F acts also naturally on X(T)  and defines thus  an endomorphism of  V, which is  of the form q F₀, where F₀∈ GL(V) is of finite order and normalizes W. We get thus a Coxeter  coset WF₀⊂GL(V).  The data  (X(𝐓), Φ,  Y(𝐓), Φ*,  F₀), and the integer   q  completely  determine  up   to  isomorphism  the  associated reductive finite group 𝐆^F. Thus these data is a way of representing in the  essential  information  which  determines  a  finite  reductive group. Indeed, all properties of Chevalley groups can be computed from that datum: symbols  representing characters, conjugacy classes,  and finally the whole character table of 𝐆^F.\n\nIt  turns out that  many interesting objects  attached to this datum depend only on (V,W, F₀): the order of the maximal tori, the fake degrees, the order  of 𝐆^F, symbols representing unipotent characters, Deligne-Lusztig induction  in  terms  of  almost  characters, the Fourier matrix relating characters and almost characters, etc… (see, e.g., Broue-Malle-Michel1993).  It is thus possible to extend their  construction to non-crystallographic groups (or even to more general complex  reflection groups,  see spets);  this is  why we did not include  a root  system in  the definition  of a reflection coset. However, unipotent conjugacy classes for instance depend on the root system.\n\nWe assume now that 𝐓 is contained in an F-stable Borel subgroup of 𝐆. This  defines an order  on the roots,  and there is  a unique element ϕ∈ W F₀,  the  reduced  element  of  the  coset,  which  preserves the set of positive  roots.  It  thus  defines  a  diagram  automorphism, that is an automorphism  of the Coxeter system (W,S).  This element is stored in the component  .phi of the coset record. It may be defined without mentioning the  roots,  as  follows:  (W,F₀(S))  is  another  Coxeter  system,  thus conjugate to S by a unique element of W, thus there is a unique element ϕ∈  WF₀ which stabilizes S (a proof  follows from Theoreme 1, chap. V, §3  Bourbaki1968). We  consider thus  cosets of the form Wϕ where ϕ stabilizes S. The coset W ϕ is completely defined by the permutation  .phi  when  𝐆  is  semi-simple  –-  equivalently when Φ generates  V; in this  case we just  need to specify  phi to define the coset.\n\nThere is a slight generalisation of the above setup, covering in particular the  case of the Ree  and Suzuki groups. We  consider 𝐆^F where F not a Frobenius  endomorphism, but  an isogeny  such that  some power  F^n is a Frobenius endomorphism. Then F still defines an endomorphism of V which normalizes  W; we define a real number q such that F^n is attached to an  𝔽_{qⁿ}-structure. Then we still have F=q F₀ where F₀ is of finite order  but q is no more an integer.  Thus F₀∈ GL(V⊗ ℝ) but F₀∉ GL(V). For  instance, for the  Ree and Suzuki  groups, F₀ is  an automorphism of order  2 of W, which is of type G₂, B₂ or F₄, and q=√2 for B₂ and  F₄ and q=√3  for G₂ This  can be constructed  starting from root systems  for G₂, B₂ or  F₄ where all the  roots have the same length. This kind of root system is not crystallographic. Such non-crystallographic  root systems exist for all finite Coxeter groups such as  the dihedral groups, H₃ and H₄. We will call here Weyl cosets the cosets  corresponding to rational forms  of algebraic groups, which include thus some non-rational roots systems for B₂, G₂ and F₄.\n\nSpets\n\nWe  now extend the above notions  to general complex reflection groups. Let W⊂  GL(V) be a complex reflection group  on the vector space V. Let ϕ be  an element  of GL(V)  which normalizes  W. Then  the coset  Wϕ is called a reflection coset.\n\nA reference for these cosets is Broue-Malle-Michel 1999. When W is a so-called Spetsial group, they are the basic object for the construction  of  a  Spetses,  which  is  an object attached to a complex reflection  group from which one can derive combinatorially some attributes shared with finite reductive groups, like unipotent degrees, etc….\n\nWe  say that  a reflection  coset is  irreducible if  W is irreducible. A general  coset is a direct  product of descents of  scalars, which is the case  where ϕ  is transitive  on the  irreducible components  of W. The irreducible    cosets   have   been   classified   in   Broue-Malle-Michel 1999:  up to multiplication of ϕ by a scalar, there is usually only one or two possible cosets for a given irreducible group.\n\nWe  deal only  with finite  order cosets,  that is,  we assume there is a (minimal) integer δ such that (Wϕ)^δ=W. Then the group generated by W and ϕ is finite, of order δ|W|.\n\nA  subset C  of a  Wϕ is  called a  conjugacy class  if one of the following equivalent conditions is fulfilled:\n\nC is the orbit of an element in Wϕ under the conjugation action of W.\nC is a conjugacy class of ⟨W,ϕ⟩ contained in Wϕ.\nThe set {w∈ W|wϕ∈ C} is  a ϕ-conjugacy  class of W (two elements\n\nv,w∈  W are called ϕ-conjugate, if and only if there exists x∈ W with v=xwϕ(x⁻¹)).\n\nAn irreducible character of ⟨W,ϕ⟩ has some non-zero values on Wϕ if and only if its restriction to W is irreducible. Further, two characters χ₁ and  χ₂  which  have  same  irreducible  restriction  to  W differ by a character  of  the  cyclic  group  ⟨ϕ⟩  (which identifies to the quotient ⟨W,ϕ⟩/W). A set containing one extension to ⟨W,ϕ⟩ of each ϕ-invariant character  of W is called a set  of irreducible characters of Wϕ. Two such  characters  are  orthogonal  for  the  scalar  product  on  the class functions on Wϕ given by χψ=W¹_w Wχ(wϕ)overlineψ(wϕ) For rational groups (Weyl groups), Lusztig has defined a choice of a set of irreducible  characters for  Wϕ (called  the preferred extensions), but for  more  general  reflection  cosets  we  have made some rather arbitrary choices,  which  however  have  the  property  that their values lie in the smallest possible field.\n\nThe  character  table  of  Wϕ  is  the  table  of  values  of  a set of irreducible characters on the conjugacy classes.\n\nA subcoset Lwϕ of Wϕ is given by a reflection subgroup L of W and an element w of W such that wϕ normalizes L.\n\nWe  then have a natural notion of  restriction of class functions on Wϕ to  class  functions  on  Lwϕ  as  well  as  of  induction in the other direction.  These  maps  are  adjoint  with  respect  to the scalar product defined above (see Broue-Malle-Michel 1999).\n\nIn  this package the most general construction  of a reflection coset is by starting  from a reflection datum, and giving in addition the matrix F of the  map ϕ:V→ V  (see the command  spets). However, at present, general cosets are only implemented for groups represented as permutation groups on a  set of roots, and  it is required that  the automorphism given preserves this  set up to  a scalar (it  is allowed that  these scalars depend on the pair  of an  irreducible component  and its  image). It  is also allowed to specify  ϕ by the permutation it induces on the roots; in this case it is assumed  that ϕ acts  trivially on the  orthogonal of the  roots, but the roots  could be those of a parent group, generating a larger space. Thus in any  case we have  a permutation representation  of ⟨W,ϕ⟩ and we consider the coset to be a set of permutations.\n\nReflection  cosets  are  implemented  in  by  a  struct which points to a reflection  group  record  and  has  additional  fields holding F and the corresponding  permutation phi. In the general case, on each component of W  which is  a descent  of scalars,  F will  permute the components and differ  by a scalar on each  component from an automorphism which preserves the  roots. In this case, we have  a permutation phi and a scalar which is stored for that component.\n\nThe  most common situation where cosets  with non-trivial phi arise is as sub-cosets  of reflection groups. Here is an \"exotic\" example, see the next chapter for more classical examples involving Coxeter groups.\n\njulia> W=complex_reflection_group(14)\nG₁₄\n\njulia> R=reflection_subgroup(W,[2,4])\nG₁₄₍₂₄₎=G₅\n\njulia> RF=spets(R,W(1)) # should be ²G₅(√6)\nG₁₄₍₂₄₎=²G₅\n\njulia> diagram(RF)\nϕ acts as (1,2) on the component below\n③ ══③ G₅\n1   2\n\njulia> degrees(RF)\n2-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Cyc{Int64}}}:\n (6, 1)\n (12, -1)\n\nThe  last line shows for each  reflection degree the corresponding factor of  the coset, which is  the scalar by which  ϕ acts on the corresponding fundamental reflection invariant.

The function  repr gives a form which could be input back in Julia. With the same data as above we have:\n\njulia> print(RF)\nspets(reflection_subgroup(complex_reflection_group(14),[2, 4]),perm\"(1,3)(2,4)(5,9)(6,10)(7,11)(8,12)(13,21)(14,22)(15,23)(16,24)(17,25)(18,26)(19,27)(20,28)(29,41)(30,42)(31,43)(32,44)(33,45)(34,46)(35,47)(36,48)(37,49)(38,50)(39,51)(40,52)(53,71)(54,72)(55,73)(56,74)(57,75)(58,76)(59,77)(60,78)(62,79)(64,80)(65,81)(66,82)(67,69)(68,70)(83,100)(84,101)(85,102)(87,103)(89,99)(90,97)(91,98)(92,96)(93,104)(94,95)(105,113)(106,114)(109,111)(110,112)(115,118)(116,117)(119,120)\")\n\nConjugacy  classes and irreducible characters of Coxeter cosets are defined as  for  general  reflection  cosets.  For  irreducible  characters of Weyl cosets,  we choose (following Lusztig) for each ϕ-stable character of W a  particular extension to a character of  W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩, which we will call the preferred extension. The character table of the coset Wϕ is the table of  the restrictions to  Wϕ of the  preferred extensions. The question of finding the conjugacy classes and character table of a Coxeter coset can be reduced to the case of irreducible root systems R.\n\nThe automorphism ϕ permutes the irreducible components of W, and Wϕ  is a direct  product of cosets  where ϕ permutes cyclically the irreducible components of W. The preferred extension is defined to be the  direct  product  of  the  preferred  extension  in  each  of these situations.\nAssume now that Wϕ is a descent of scalars, that is the decomposition in irreducible components W=W₁× ⋯ × Wₖ is cyclically permuted by ϕ. Then there are natural bijections from the ϕ-conjugacy classes of W to  the ϕᵏ-conjugacy classes  of W₁ as  well as from the ϕ-stable characters  of W to the ϕᵏ-stable  characters of W₁, which reduce the  definition of preferred  extensions on Wϕ  to the definition for W₁ϕᵏ.\nAssume now  that W  is the  Coxeter group  of an  irreducible root system.   ϕ  permutes  the  simple   roots,  hence  induces  a  graph automorphism  on  the  corresponding  Dynkin  diagram.  If  ϕ=1  then conjugacy  classes and  characters coincide  with those  of the Coxeter group W.\n\nThe  nontrivial cases for crystallographic roots  systems are (the order of ϕ  is written as left exponent to  the type): ²Aₙ, ²Dₙ, ³D₄, ²E₆. For  non-crystallographic root  systems where  all the  roots have the same length the additional cases ²B₂, ²G₂, ²F₄ and ²I₂(k) arise.\n\nIn  case  ³D₄  the  group  W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩  can be embedded into the Coxeter  group of type F₄, which induces a labeling for the conjugacy classes of the coset. The preferred extension is chosen as the (single) extension with rational values.\nIn case  ²Dₙ the  group W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩  is isomorphic  to a Coxeter group of type Bₙ. This induces a canonical labeling for the conjugacy classes  of the coset and allows to define the preferred extension in a combinatorial  way  using  the  labels  (pairs  of  partitions) for the characters of the Coxeter group of type Bₙ.\nIn the remaining crystallographic cases ϕ identifies to -w₀ where w₀  is the longest element of W.  So, there is a canonical labeling of  the conjugacy classes and characters of  the coset by those of W. The  preferred extensions  are defined  by describing  the signs of the character values on -w₀.\n\nThe  most general  construction of  a Coxeter  coset is  by starting from a Coxeter   datum   specified   by   the   matrices   of   simpleRoots  and simplecoroots,  and  giving  in  addition  the  matrix F0Mat of the map F₀:V→ V (see the commands  CoxeterCoset and CoxeterSubCoset). As for Coxeter  groups,  the  elements  of  Wϕ  are  uniquely  determined by the permutation  they  induce  on  the  set  of  roots  R.  We consider these permutations as elements of the Coxeter coset.\n\nCoxeter  cosets are implemented by a struct which points to a Coxeter datum record  and  has  additional  fields  holding F0Mat and the corresponding element  phi. Functions on the coset (for example, classinfo) are about properties  of  the  group  coset  W  ϕ  ;  however, most definitions for elements of untwisted Coxeter groups apply without change to elements in W ϕ:  e.g., if we define the length of  an element wϕ∈ Wϕ as the number of positive  roots it sends to negative ones, it  is the same as the length of w,  i.e., ϕ is of length 0, since ϕ has been chosen to preserve the set of positive roots. Similarly, the Coxeter word describing wϕ is the same as the one for w, etc…\n\nWe associate to a Coxeter coset Wϕ a twisted Dynkin diagram, consisting of  the Dynkin diagram of W and  the graph automorphism induced by ϕ on this  diagram (this specifies the  group W⋊ ⟨F⟩, mentioned above, up to  isomorphism). See the  functions ReflectionType, ReflectionName and diagram for Coxeter cosets.\n\nBelow  is an example showing first how to not define, then how to define, the Weyl coset for a Suzuki group:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:B,2)\nB₂\n\njulia> spets(W,Perm(1,2))\nERROR: matrix F must preserve the roots\nStacktrace:\n [1] error(::String) at ./error.jl:33\n [2] spets(::Gapjm.Weyl.FCG{Int16,Int64,PRG{Int64,Int16}}, ::Matrix{Int64}) at /home/jmichel/julia/Gapjm/src/Cosets.jl:241 (repeats 2 times)\n [3] top-level scope at REPL[19]:1\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:Bsym,2)\nBsym₂\n\njulia> WF=spets(W,Perm(1,2))\n²Bsym₂\n\njulia> CharTable(WF)\nCharTable(²Bsym₂)\n   │    1 121\n───┼──────────\n2. │1   1   1\n.11│1  -1  -1\n1.1│. -√2  √2\n\nA subcoset Hwϕ of Wϕ is given by a reflection subgroup H of W and an  element w of W  such that wϕ induces  an automorphism of the root system of H.

They have groups of fractions which in  both cases are the  braid group. Here we  implement braid groups in the framework of a general implementation of Garside monoids and groups.\n\nTo  define Garside monoids we  introduce some vocabulary about divisibility in  monoids. A left  divisor of x  is a d  such that there exists y with  x=dy (and then  we say that  x is a  right multiple of d, and write  d≼ x). We say that a monoid M is left cancellable if an equality dx=dy  implies  x=y.  We  define  symmetrically  right  divisors,  left multiples and right cancellability. We say that x is an atom if 1 and x  are its only  divisors. A left  gcd of x  and y is a common left divisor  d of x  and y such  that any other  common left divisor is a left  divisor of d.  Similarly a right  lcm of x  and y is a common multiple which is a left divisor of any other common multiple.\n\nWe  call Garside a monoid M which:\n\nis left and right cancellable.\nis generated by its atoms.\nadmits left and  right  gcds  and  lcms.\nis such that any element has only finitely many left (or right) divisors.\nadmits a Garside element, which is an element Δ whose set of left and right divisors coincide and generate M.\n\nGarside  elements are not  unique, but there  is a unique  minimal one (for divisibility);  we assume a  Garside element Δ  has been chosen. Then the divisors  of Δ are called  the simples of M.  A Garside monoid embeds into  its group of fractions, which is  called a Garside group (a Garside group  may have  several distinct  Garside structures,  as we  will see for Braid groups of finite Coxeter groups).\n\nWe  also implement locally Garside monoids,  which are monoids where lcms do  not always exist, but exist when any common multiple exists; the set of simples  is then not defined using a  Garside element, but by the condition that  they contain the atoms and are  closed under lcms and taking divisors (see  BDM01); since it is  not ensured by the existence of  Δ, one  has to  add the  condition that  any element  is divisible by finitely many simples (but the number of simples can be infinite). The main example  is the Artin monoid of an  infinite Coxeter group. It is not known if  these monoids embed in  their group of fractions  (though that has been proved for braid monoids of Coxeter groups by Paris Paris01)  and thus  computing in  the monoid does not help  for computing in the group (only  the monoid is implemented for these cases).\n\nWhat allows computing with Garside and locally Garside monoids, and Garside groups,  is the fact  that they admit  normal forms –-  these normal forms where   exhibited  for   braid  monoids   of  Coxeter   groups  by  Deligne Del72,  who extended previous  work of Brieskorn, Saito BS72 and Garside Gar69:\n\n(1) Let M be a locally Garside monoid and let b∈ M. Then there is a unique  maximal left simple divisor α(b)  of b –- any other simple dividing b on the left divides α(b) on the left.\n(2) Assume M is a Garside monoid, Δ is its Garside element and G is  its group of  fractions. Then, given  any element x∈  G, there is some power i such that Δⁱ x∈ M.\n\nA consequence of (1) is that any element has a canonical decomposition as a product of simples, called its left-greedy normal form. If we define ω(x) by  x=α(x)ω(x), then the normal form of x is α(x)α(ω(x))α(ω^2(x))… We use  the normal form to represent elements  of M, and when M is Garside (2)  to represent  elements of  G: given  x∈ G  we compute the smallest power  i  such  that  Δⁱ  x∈  M,  and  we  represent  x by the couple (i,Δ⁻ⁱx).  We are thus reduced to the case where x∈ M, not divisible by Δ,  where we represent  x by the  sequence of simples which constitutes its normal form.\n\nWe  now describe Artin-Tits braid monoids. Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system, that is W has presentation\n\n⟨s∈ S∣s²=1, sts⋯ =tst⋯   (mₛₜ factors on each side) for s,t∈ S⟩\n\nfor  some Coxeter matrix mₛₜ for s,t∈ S. The braid group B associated to (W,S) is the group defined by the presentation\n\n⟨𝐬∈ 𝐒∣ 𝐬𝐭𝐬⋯ =𝐭𝐬𝐭⋯  (mₛₜ factors on each side) for 𝐬,𝐭∈ 𝐒⟩\n\nThe positive braid monoid B⁺ associated to W is the monoid defined by the  presentation above –- it identifies to the submonoid of B generated by  𝐒 by  the result  of Paris  mentioned above.  This monoid  is locally Garside,  with set of simples  in bijection with elements  of W and atoms the elements of 𝐒; we will denote by 𝐖 the set of simples, and by 𝐰 ↦ w  the bijection between simples and elements  of W. The group W has a length  defined  in  terms  of  reduced expressions. Similarly, having only homogeneous relations, B⁺ has a natural length function. Then 𝐖 can be characterized  as the subset of the elements  of B⁺ of the same length as their image in W.\n\nIf  W is finite, then B⁺ is Garside with Garside element the element of 𝐖 whose image is the longest element  of W. A finite Coxeter group is also  a reflection group in  a real vector space,  thus in its complexified V,  and B has also a topological definition as the fundamental group of the  space Vʳᵉᵍ/W, where Vʳᵉᵍ  is the set of  elements of V which are fixed  by no  non-identity element  of S;  however, we  will not use this here.\n\nWe  implement in general only  monoids which have a  finite number of atoms (there  is a special implementation for the Dual monoid of the affine group ÃₙA). \n\nGiven a Coxeter group W,\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,4)\nA₄\n\njulia> B=BraidMonoid(W)\nBraidMonoid(A₄)\n\nconstructs  the  associated  braid  monoid,  and  then  as  a  function B constructs  elements of the braid monoid (or group when W is finite) from a list of generators (below B(1,2,3,4) represents 𝐬₁𝐬₂𝐬₃𝐬₄):\n\njulia> w=B(1,2,3,4)\n1234\n\njulia> w^3  # the terms of the normal form are separated by a `.`\n121321432.343\n\njulia> word(α(w^3))\n9-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 3\n 2\n 1\n 4\n 3\n 2\n\njulia> w^4\nΔ.232432\n\njulia> inv(w)\n(1234)⁻¹\n\nHow  an  element  of  a  Garside  group  is  printed  is  controlled by the IOcontext  attribute  ':greedy'.  By  default,  elements  are  printed as fractions a⁻¹b where a and b have no left common divisor. Each of a and  b is printed  using its left-greedy  normal form, that  is a maximal power of the Garside element followed by the rest. One can print the entire element   in  the  left-greedy  normal  from  by  setting  the  IOContext :greedy=>true; with the same w as above we have:\n\njulia> repr(w^-1,context=IOContext(stdout,:greedy=>true,:limit=>true))\n\"Δ⁻¹.232432\"\n\nBy default,  repr gives   w  back   in  a   form  which   after  assigning B=BraidMonoid(W) can be input back into Julia:\n\njulia> repr(w)\n\"B(1,2,3,4)\"\n\njulia> repr(w^3)\n\"B(1,2,1,3,2,1,4,3,2,3,4,3)\"\n\njulia> repr(w^-1)\n\"B(-4,-3,-2,-1)\"\n\nIn  general elements of a  Garside monoid are displayed  as a list of their constituting atoms.\n\nWe  now describe the dual braid monoid.  For that, we first define interval monoids.  Given a group W and a set S of generators of W as a monoid, we  define the S-length l_S(w) as the minimum number of elements of S needed  to write w. We  then define left divisors  of x as the d such that  there exists y with x=dy  and l_S(d)+l_S(y)=l_S(x). We say that w∈ W is balanced if its set of left and right divisors coincide; in which case  we  denote  this  set  by  [1,w],  an  \"interval\"  for the poset of S-divisibility.  We say that w  is Garside for the  S-length if it is balanced  and [1,w] is a  lattice (where upper and  lower bounds are lcms and gcds), which generates W. Then we have the theorem:\n\nSuppose  w  is  Garside  for  the  S-length.  Then  the monoid M with generators  [1,w] and relations  xy=z whenever xy=z  holds in W and l_S(x)+l_S(y)=l_S(z), is a Garside monoid, with simples [1,w] and atoms S. It is called the interval monoid defined by the interval [1,w].\n\nThe  Artin-Tits braid monoid  is an interval  monoid by taking  for S the Coxeter  generators, in which case l_S  is the Coxeter length, and taking for w the longest element of W. The dual monoid, constructed by Birman, Ko  and  Lee  for  type  A  and  by Bessis for all well-generated complex reflection  groups, is obtained in  a similar way, by  taking this time for w  a Coxeter element, for l_S the reflection length 'reflength' and for S_S  the  reflections  which  divide  w  for the reflection length (for Coxeter  groups all reflections  divide w but  for well-generated complex reflection  groups not  all reflections  divide); for  the dual  monoid the simples  are of cardinality  the generalized Catalan  numbers catalan. An interval  monoid has naturally an inverse  morphism from M to W, called 'image'  which is the  quotient map from  the interval monoid  to W which sends back simple braids to [1,w].\n\nA last pertinent notion is reversible monoids. Since we store left normal forms,  it is easy to compute left lcms and gcds, but hard to compute right lcms  and gcds. But this becomes easy to  do if the monoid has an operation 'reverse',  which has the property that 'a' is a left divisor of 'b' if and only  if 'reverse(a)'  is a  right divisor  of 'reverse(b)'. This holds for Artin-Tits  and dual braid monoids of groups generated by true reflections; Artin-Tits monoids have a reverse operation which consists of reversing a word,  written as  a list  of atoms.  The dual  monoid also has a reverse operation  defined in the  same way, but  this operation changes monoid: it goes  from the dual monoid  for the Coxeter element  w to the dual monoid for  the Coxeter element  w⁻¹. The operations  'rightlcm' and 'rightgcd', and  some other algorithms, have faster implementations if the monoid has a reverse operation.\n\nThis  module implements also  functions to solve  the conjugacy problem and compute  centralizers  in  Garside  groups,  following  the work of Franco, Gebhardt and Gonzalez-Meneses.\n\nTwo  elements w and w' of a monoid  M are conjugate in M if there exists  x∈ M such that wx=xw'; if  M satisfies the Öre conditions, it has  a  group  of  fractions  where  this  becomes  x⁻¹wx=w',  the  usual definition  of conjugacy. A special case  which is even closer to conjugacy in  the group is if there exists y∈  M such that w=xy and w'=yx. This relation  is not transitive in general,  but we call cyclic conjugacy the transitive closure of this relation, a restricted form of conjugacy.\n\nThe  next  observation  is  that  if  w,w'  are conjugate in the group of fractions  of the Garside monoid M then  they are conjugate in M, since if  wx=xw' then  there is  a power  Δⁱ which  is central and such that xΔⁱ∈ M. Then wxΔⁱ=xΔⁱ w' is a conjugation in M.\n\nThe  crucial observation for solving the  conjugacy problem is to introduce inf(w):=sup{i  such that  Δⁱ divides  w} and  sup(w):=inf{i such  that w divides  Δⁱ}, and to notice that the number of conjugates of w with same inf and sup as w is finite (since our monoids have a finite number of atoms).  Further,  a  theorem  of  Birman  shows that the maximum inf and minimum  sup in  a conjugacy  class can  be achieved  simultaneously; the elements  achieving this are called the super summit set of w. Thus a way to  determine if two elements are conjugate  is to find a representative of both  of them in  their super summit  set, and then  solve conjugacy within that  set. This can also be used  to compute the centralizer of an element: if  we consider  the super  summit set  as the  objects of a category whose morphisms are the conjugations by simple elements, the centralizer is given by the endomorphisms of the given object.\n\nWe illustrate this on an example:\n\njulia> b=B(2,1,4,1,4)\n214.14\n\njulia> c=B(1,4,1,4,3)\n14.143\n\njulia> d=conjugating_elt(b,c)\n(1)⁻¹21321432\n\njulia> b^d\n14.143\n\njulia> centralizer_gens(b)\n3-element Vector{GarsideElt{Perm{Int16}, BraidMonoid{Perm{Int16}, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}}}:\n 321432.213243\n 21.1\n 4\n\njulia> C=conjcat(b;ss=:ss)\ncategory with 10 objects and 32 generating maps\n\njulia> C.obj\n10-element Vector{GarsideElt{Perm{Int16}, BraidMonoid{Perm{Int16}, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}}}:\n 1214.4\n 214.14\n 124.24\n 1343.1\n 14.124\n 143.13\n 24.214\n 134.14\n 13.134\n 14.143\n\nThere   is  a   faster  solution   to  the   conjugacy  problem   given  in gebgon10:  for each b∈ M, they define a particular simple  left divisor of b, its preferred prefix such that the operation sliding  which  cyclically  conjugates  b  by  its preferred prefix, is eventually periodic, and the period is contained in the super summit set of x.  We say that x is in its sliding circuit if some iterated sliding of x is equal to x. The set of sliding circuits in a given conjugacy class is  smaller than the super  summit set, thus allows  to solve the conjugacy problem faster.

It is true (but a non-trivial theorem) that in a Coxeter group the order  of st is exactly  m(s,t), thus a Coxeter  group is the same as a Coxeter  system, that is a pair (W,S) of a group W and a set S⊂W of involutions,  such  that  the  group  is  presented  by  generators S and relations describing the order of the product of two elements of S.\n\nA   Coxeter   group   has   a   natural   representation,  its  reflection representation, on a real vector space V of dimension length(S) (which is  the  Coxeter  rank  of  W),  where  each  element  of  S  acts as a reflection; the faithfulness of this representation in the main argument to prove  that the order  of st is  exactly m(s,t). This representation is defined as follows on a space V with basis {eₛ} for s∈ S. The cartan matrix  associated to the  Coxeter matrix m(s,t)  is the matrix C with entries  C(s,t)=-2cos(π/m(s,t)); we  set C(s,t)=-2  if m(s,t)=∞. Then the action of s∈ S on V is given by s(eₜ)=eₜ-C(s,t)eₛ.\n\nThus, Coxeter groups are  real reflection groups.  The converse need not be true  if the set of reflecting  hyperplanes has bad topological properties, but  it turns out  that finite Coxeter  groups are the  same as finite real reflection  groups. The possible Coxeter matrices for finite Coxeter groups have  been  completely  classified,  see  Weyl; the corresponding finite groups play a deep role in several areas of mathematics.\n\nCoxeter  groups  have  a  nice  solution  to the word problem. The length l(w)  of an element  w∈ W is  the minimum number  of elements of S of which it is a product (since the elements of S are involutions, we do not need inverses). An expression of w of minimal length is called a reduced word  for w. The main property of  reduced words is the exchange lemma which  states that if s₁…sₖ is a reduced word for w (thus k=l(w)) and s∈  S is such that l(sw)≤l(w) then one  of the sᵢ in the word for w can be deleted to obtain a reduced word for sw. Thus given s∈ S and w∈ W,  either l(sw)=l(w)+1 or  l(sw)=l(w)-1 and we  say in this last case that  s belongs to  the left descent  set of w.  The computation of a reduced  word for an element, and other  word problems, are easy if we know how to multiply elements and know left descent sets. In each of the Coxeter groups  that we implement, the left descent set is easy to compute (see for example  CoxSym below), so this suggests how to deal with Coxeter groups generically:\n\nThe  type  CoxeterGroup  is  an  abstract  type;  an  actual struct which implements it must define a function\n\nisleftdescent(W,w,i) which tells whether the i-th element of S is in    the left descent set of w.\n\nthe other functions needed in an instance of a Coxeter group are\n\ngens(W) which returns the set S (the list of Coxeter generators)\nnref(W) which  returns the  number of  reflections of  W, if  W is  finite or nothing if W is infinite.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  a  Coxeter  group  can  be any kind of group implementing the above functions.\n\nBecause  of the  easy solution  of the  word problem  in Coxeter  groups, a convenient  way  to  represent  their  elements  is as words in the Coxeter generators,  that  is  lists  of  integers  in 1:length(S). The functions 'word'  and 'W(...)' does the conversion between Coxeter words and elements of the group.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> W=CoxSym(4)\n𝔖 ₄\n\njulia> p=W(1,3,2,1,3)\n(1,4)\n\njulia> word(W,p)\n5-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 2\n 1\n\nWe  notice that the word we started with and the one that we ended up with, are not the same, though they represent the same element of W. The reason is  there are  several reduced  words for  an element  of W. The function 'word'  computes a lexicographically smallest word  for w. Below are some other possible computations with the same Coxeter group:\n\njulia> word(W,longest(W))  # the (unique) longest element in W\n6-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 3\n 2\n 1\n\njulia> w0=longest(W)\n(1,4)(2,3)\n\njulia> length(W,w0)\n6\njulia> map(w->word(W,w),refls(W,1:nref(W)))\n6-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:\n [1]\n [2]\n [3]\n [1, 2, 1]\n [2, 3, 2]\n [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\njulia> [length(elements(W,i)) for i in 0:nref(W)]\n7-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 3\n 5\n 6\n 5\n 3\n 1\n\nThe  last list tells us that there is 1 element of length 0, there are 6 of length 3, …\n\nFor  most basic functions the convention is that the input is an element of the  group, rather than  a Coxeter word.

We  want to  study the  irreducible characters  of 𝐆 ^F.  More generally we consider 𝐆 ^F where F is an isogeny of 𝐆  such  that  a  power  is  a  Frobenius  (this covers the Suzuki and Ree groups).\n\nIf  𝐓 is an F-stable  maximal torus of 𝐆, and 𝐁 is a (not necessarily  F-stable) Borel  subgroup containing  𝐓, we define the Deligne-Lusztig  variety X_𝐁=g𝐁  𝐆  𝐁  g𝐁   F(g𝐁 ) . This variety  affords  a  natural  action  of  𝐆  ^F  on  the  left,  so the corresponding   Deligne-Lusztig  virtual  module  H^*_c(X_𝐁)=ᵢ  (-1)ⁱ Hⁱ_c(X_𝐁ℚ  _ℓ)  also.  The  (virtual)  character  of this module is the Deligne-Lusztig  character  R_𝐓  ^𝐆  (1);  the  notation reflects the theorem  that this character does  not depend on the  choice of 𝐁. This character  can be  parameterized by  an F-conjugacy  class of W: if 𝐓₀𝐁₀  is an F-stable pair, there is an unique w W=N_𝐆 (𝐓₀)𝐓₀ such  that the triple (𝐓𝐁F) is 𝐆-conjugate to (𝐓₀𝐁₀wF). We will  thus denote R_w for R_𝐓^𝐆 (1); this character depends only on the F-class of w.\n\nThe  unipotent characters of 𝐆 ^F are the irreducible constituents of the  R_w. In a similar way that the Jordan decomposition shows that the unipotent classes are a building block for describing the conjugacy classes of  a  reductive  group,  Lusztig  has  defined  a  Jordan decomposition of characters  where  the  unipotent  characters  are  the building block. The unipotent  characters are parameterized by  combinatorial data that Lusztig has  defined just  from the  coset Wφ,  where φ  is the  finite order automorphism  of X(𝐓₀)  such that  F=qφ. Thus,  from our viewpoint, unipotent  characters  are  objects  combinatorially  attached to a Coxeter coset.\n\nA  subset  of  the  unipotent  characters, the principal series unipotent characters,  can  be  described  in  a  more  elementary  way. They are the constituents  of  R₁,  or  equivalently  the  characters of the virtual module  H^*_c(X_𝐁 ₀), where X_𝐁 ₀  is the discrete variety (𝐆 𝐁₀)^F;  this virtual module reduces to the actual module ℚ _ℓ(𝐆 𝐁₀) ^F.  Thus  the  Deligne-Lusztig  induction  R_𝐓₀^𝐆  (1) reduces to Harish-Chandra  induction, defined  as follows:  let 𝐏  =𝐔   𝐋  be an F-stable  Levi decomposition  of an  F-stable parabolic subgroup of 𝐆. Then the Harish-Chandra induced  R_𝐋^𝐆 of a character χ of  𝐋^F is  the character  Ind_𝐏^F^𝐆 ^Fχ,  where χ is the lift  to 𝐏^F of χ via the quotient 𝐏^F𝐔 ^F=𝐋^F; Harish-Chandra induction  is a  particular case  of Lusztig  induction, which is defined when 𝐏 is not F-stable using the variety X_𝐔 = g𝐔 𝐆 𝐔  g𝐔  F(g𝐔  ), and gives for an  𝐋^F-module a virtual 𝐆 ^F-module. Like  ordinary induction, these  functors have adjoint  functors going from representations   of   𝐆   ^F   to   representations   (resp.   virtual representations)   of  𝐋^F  called  Harish-Chandra  restriction  (resp. Lusztig restriction).\n\nThe  commuting algebra of 𝐆^F-endomorphisms of R₁=R_𝐓₀^𝐆(1) is an Iwahori-Hecke  algebra for W^φ, with parameters some powers of q; the parameters  are  all  equal  to  q  when W^φ=W. Thus principal series unipotent characters are parametrized by characters of W^φ.\n\nTo   understand  the  decomposition  of  more  general  R_w,  and  thus parameterize unipotent characters, is is useful to introduce another set of class  functions which are  parameterized by irreducible  characters of the coset  Wφ.  If  χ  is  such  a  character, we define the associated almost  character by:  Rᵪ=W¹_w Wχ(wφ)  R_w. The  name reflects that these class function are close to irreducible characters. They satisfy Rᵪ  R_ψ_𝐆^F=δ_χψ;  for  the  linear  and unitary group they are actually  unipotent characters (up to sign in the latter case). They are in general the sum (with rational coefficients) of a small number of unipotent characters in the same Lusztig family, see Families. The degree of  Rᵪ  is  a  polynomial  in  q  equal  to  the fake degree of the character χ of Wφ (see fakedegree).\n\nWe   now  describe  the  parameterization   of  unipotent  characters  when W^φ=W,  thus when the coset Wφ identifies with W (the situation is  similar  but  a  bit  more  difficult  to  describe  in  general).  The (rectangular) matrix of scalar products ρ Rᵪ_𝐆 ^F, when characters of  W  and  unipotent  characters  are  arranged in the right order, is block-diagonal   with  rather  small  blocks   which  are  called  Lusztig families.\n\nFor the characters of W  a family 𝓕 corresponds  to a block of the Hecke  algebra  over  a  ring  called  the  Rouquier ring. To 𝓕 Lusztig associates  a small group Γ (not  bigger than (ℤ2)ⁿ, or 𝔖ᵢ for i5) such that the unipotent characters in the family are parameterized by the pairs (xθ) taken up to Γ-conjugacy, where xΓ and θ is  an irreducible character of C_Γ(x).  Further, the elements of 𝓕 themselves are parameterized by a subset of such pairs, and Lusztig defines a  pairing  between  such  pairs  which  computes  the scalar product ρ Rᵪ_𝐆^F,  called  the  Lusztig  Fourier  matrix. For more details see drinfeld_double.\n\nA  second parameterization  of unipotent  character is  via Harish-Chandra series.  A character is called cuspidal if all its proper Harish-Chandra restrictions  vanish. There are few  cuspidal unipotent characters (none in GLₙ  for  n1,  and  at  most  one  in other classical groups). The 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra of an Harish-Chandra induced R_𝐋^F^𝐆^Fλ, where λ is a cuspidal unipotent character turns out to be a Hecke algebra associated to the group W_𝐆^F(𝐋^F)=N_𝐆^F(𝐋)𝐋, which turns out to be a Coxeter group. Thus another  parameterization  is  by  triples  (𝐋λφ),  where  λ is a cuspidal  unipotent  character  of  𝐋^F  and  φ  is  an irreducible character  of the  relative group  W_𝐆^F(𝐋^F). Such  characters are said to belong to the Harish-Chandra series determined by (𝐋λ).\n\nA  final  piece  of  information  attached  to  unipotent characters is the eigenvalues of Frobenius. Let Fᵟ be the smallest power of the isogeny F  which  is  a  split  Frobenius  (that  is, Fᵟ is a Frobenius and φᵟ=1). Then Fᵟ acts naturally on Deligne-Lusztig varieties and thus on  the  corresponding  virtual  modules,  and  commutes  to  the action of 𝐆^F;  thus for  a given  unipotent character  ρ, a submodule of the virtual  module which  affords ρ  affords a  single eigenvalue μ of Fᵟ. Results of Lusztig and Digne-Michel show that this eigenvalue is of the  form qᵃᵟλᵨ  where 2aℤ  and λᵨ  is a  root of  unity which depends  only on ρ and not the considered module. This λᵨ is called the  eigenvalue of Frobenius attached to ρ. Unipotent characters in the Harish-Chandra  series  of  a  pair  (𝐋λ)  have the same eigenvalue of Frobenius as λ.\n\nThis  package  contains  tables  of  all  this information, and can compute Harish-Chandra  and Lusztig  induction of  unipotent characters  and almost characters. We illustrate this on some examples:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)\nG₂\n\njulia> uc=UnipotentCharacters(W)\nUnipotentCharacters(G₂)\n      γ│   Deg(γ)  Feg Fr(γ)    label\n───────┼──────────────────────────────\nφ₁‚₀   │        1    1     1         \nφ₁‚₆   │       q⁶   q⁶     1         \nφ′₁‚₃  │  qΦ₃Φ₆/3   q³     1    (1,ρ)\nφ″₁‚₃  │  qΦ₃Φ₆/3   q³     1   (g₃,1)\nφ₂‚₁   │ qΦ₂²Φ₃/6  qΦ₈     1    (1,1)\nφ₂‚₂   │ qΦ₂²Φ₆/2 q²Φ₄     1   (g₂,1)\nG₂[-1] │ qΦ₁²Φ₃/2    0    -1   (g₂,ε)\nG₂[1]  │ qΦ₁²Φ₆/6    0     1    (1,ε)\nG₂[ζ₃] │qΦ₁²Φ₂²/3    0    ζ₃  (g₃,ζ₃)\nG₂[ζ₃²]│qΦ₁²Φ₂²/3    0   ζ₃² (g₃,ζ₃²)\n\nThe  first column gives  the name of  the unipotent character, derived from its  Harish-Chandra  classification;  the  first  6  characters  are in the principal  series  so  are  named  by  characters  of  W.

We do not explain the details of this construction, but explain how its final result building Lusztig's Fourier matrix, and a variant of it that we use in Spetses, from Γ.\n\nThe  elements of the family are in bijection  with the set 𝓜 (Γ) of pairs (x,χ)  taken up to  Γ-conjugacy, where x∈Γ  and χ is an irreducible complex-valued   character  of  C_Γ(x).  To  such  a  pair  ρ=(x,χ)  is associated  an  eigenvalue  of  Frobenius  defined  by  ω_ρ=χ(x)χ(1). Lusztig  then defines a Fourier matrix S₀ whose coefficient is given, for ρ=(x,χ) and ρ'=(x', χ'), by:\n\nS₀_ρρ=C_Γ(x)¹_ρ₁=(x₁χ₁)χ₁(x)χ(y₁)\n\nwhere  the sum is over all pairs ρ₁∈𝓜 (Γ) which are Γ-conjugate to ρ' and  such that y₁ C_Γ(x). This  coefficient also represents the scalar product ρρ_𝐆^F of the corresponding unipotent characters.\n\nA  way to  understand the  formula for  S₀_ρρ better is to consider another  basis of the complex  vector space with basis  𝓜 (Γ), indexed by the  pairs  (x,y)  taken  up  to  Γ-conjugacy,  where  x  and y are commuting  elements  of  Γ.  This  basis  is  called  the basis of Mellin transforms, and given by:\n\n(xy)=_χ Irr(C_Γ(x))χ(y)(xχ)\n\nIn  the  basis  of  Mellin  transforms,  the  linear  map  S₀ is given by (x,y)↦(x⁻¹,y⁻¹)  and  the  linear  transformation  T which sends ρ to ω_ρρ   becomes  (x,y)↦(x,xy).   These  are   particular  cases  of  the permutation  representation of GL₂(ℤ)  on the basis  of Mellin transforms where beginpmatrixabcr cdendpmatrix acts by (x,y)↦(xᵃyᵇ,xᶜyᵈ).\n\nFourier  matrices in finite reductive groups  are given by the above matrix S₀.  But for non-rational Spetses, we use a different matrix S which in the  basis of Mellin transforms  is given by (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x). Equivalently, the formula S_ρρ differs from the formula for S₀_ρρ in that there  is no complex conjugation  of χ₁; thus the  matrix S is equal to S₀ multiplied on the right by the permutation matrix which corresponds to (x,χ)↦(x,χ̄).  The advantage of the matrix S over S₀ is that the pair S,T  satisfies directly the axioms for a fusion algebra (see below); also the matrix S is symmetric, while S₀ is Hermitian.\n\nThus there are two variants of 'drinfeld_double`:\n\ndrinfeld_double(g,lu=true)\n\nreturns  a family  containing Lusztig's  Fourier matrix  S₀, and an extra field  '.perm'  containing  the  permutation  of  the  indices  induced  by (x,χ)↦(x,χ̄),  which allows  to recover  S, as  well as  an extra field `:lusztig', set to 'true'.\n\ndrinfeld_double(g)\n\nreturns a family with the matrix S, which does not have fields '.lusztig' or '.perm'.\n\nThe family record 'f' returned also has the fields:\n\n:group: the group Γ.\n\n:charLabels: a list of labels describing the pairs (x,χ), and thus also specifying in which order they are taken.\n\n:fourierMat: the Fourier matrix (the matrix S or S₀ depending on the call).\n\n:eigenvalues: the eigenvalues of Frobenius.\n\n:xy: a list of pairs '[x,y]' which are representatives of the Γ-orbits of pairs of commuting elements.\n\n:mellinLabels: a list of labels describing the pairs '[x,y]'.\n\n:mellin:  the base change matrix between  the basis (x,χ) and the basis of   Mellin  transforms,   so  that   |f.fourierMat^(f.mellin^-1)|  is  the permutation  matrix (for (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x)  or (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x⁻¹) depending on the call).\n\n:special: the index of the special element, which is (x,χ)=(1,1).\n\njulia> drinfeld_double(CoxSym(3))\nFamily(D(CoxSym(3)):8)\n   label│eigen\n────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────\n(1,X.1) │    1  1/6  1/3 1/6 -3/2 -3/2  1/3  1/3  1/3\n(1,X.2) │    1  1/3  2/3 1/3    0    0 -1/3 -1/3 -1/3\n(1,1)   │    1  1/6  1/3 1/6  3/2  3/2  1/3  1/3  1/3\n(2a,X.1)│   -1 -1/6    0 1/6  1/2 -1/2    0    0    0\n(2a,1)  │    1 -1/6    0 1/6 -1/2  1/2    0    0    0\n(3a,1)  │    1  1/3 -1/3 1/3    0    0  2/3 -1/3 -1/3\n(3a,X.2)│  ζ₃²  1/3 -1/3 1/3    0    0 -1/3 -1/3  2/3\n(3a,X.3)│   ζ₃  1/3 -1/3 1/3    0    0 -1/3  2/3 -1/3\n\njulia> drinfeld_double(CoxSym(3);lu=true)\nFamily(LD(CoxSym(3)):8)\n   label│eigen\n────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────\n(1,X.1) │    1  1/6  1/3 1/6 -3/2 -3/2  1/3  1/3  1/3\n(1,X.2) │    1  1/3  2/3 1/3    0    0 -1/3 -1/3 -1/3\n(1,1)   │    1  1/6  1/3 1/6  3/2  3/2  1/3  1/3  1/3\n(2a,X.1)│   -1 -1/6    0 1/6  1/2 -1/2    0    0    0\n(2a,1)  │    1 -1/6    0 1/6 -1/2  1/2    0    0    0\n(3a,1)  │    1  1/3 -1/3 1/3    0    0  2/3 -1/3 -1/3\n(3a,X.2)│  ζ₃²  1/3 -1/3 1/3    0    0 -1/3  2/3 -1/3\n(3a,X.3)│   ζ₃  1/3 -1/3 1/3    0    0 -1/3 -1/3  2/3\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"uch.html#Gapjm.Families.ndrinfeld_double","page":"Unipotent characters","title":"Gapjm.Families.ndrinfeld_double","text":"ndrinfeld_double(g)\n\nThis  function returns the number of elements that the family associated to the  Drinfeld double of the group g would have, without computing it.

There  are  several  interesting  cases  where  the relative group N_W(Lwϕ)L,  or a subgroup of it normalizing some further data attached to L, is itself a reflection group.\n\nA first example is the case where ϕ=1 and w=1, W is the Weyl group of a   finite  reductive   group  𝐆^F   and  the   Levi  subgroup  𝐋^F corresponding  to L has a cuspidal unipotent character. Then N_W(L)L is  a  Coxeter  group  acting  on  the  space  X(Z𝐋)⊗ℝ.  A  combinatorial characterization of such parabolic subgroups of Coxeter groups is that they are  normalized by the  longest element of  larger parabolic subgroups (see 5.7.1 Lusztig1976).\n\nA  second  example  is  when  L  is  trivial  and  wϕ is a ζ-regular element,  that is  the ζ-eigenspace  V_ζ of  wϕ contains  a vector outside  all the reflecting hyperplanes of W. Then N_W(Lwϕ)L=C_W(wϕ) is a reflection group in its action on V_ζ.\n\nA similar but more general example is when V_ζ is the ζ-eigenspace of some  element of  the reflection  coset Wϕ,  and is  of maximal dimension among such possible ζ-eigenspaces. Then the set of elements of Wϕ which act  by ζ on V_ζ is a certain subcoset Lwϕ, and N_W(Lwϕ)L is a reflection group in its action on V_ζ (see 2.5 Lehrer-Springer1999).\n\nFinally,  a  still  more  general  example,  but which only occurs for Weyl groups  or  Spetsial  reflection  groups,  is  when 𝐋 is a ζ-split Levi subgroup  (which means that  the corresponding subcoset  Lwϕ is formed of all  the elements which act by ζ on  some subspace V_ζ of V), and λ is  a  d-cuspidal  unipotent  character  of  𝐋  (which  means  that the multiplicity  of ζ  as a  root of  the degree  of λ  is the same as the multiplicity  of ζ as a root of the generic order of the semi-simple part of  𝐆); then N_W(Lwϕλ)L is a complex reflection group in its action on V_ζ.\n\nFurther,  in the above cases the relative group describes the decomposition of a Lusztig induction.\n\nWhen  𝐆^F is  a finite  reductive group,  and λ  a cuspidal unipotent character  of  the  Levi  subgroup  𝐋^F,  then the 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra  of  the  Harish-Chandra  induced  representation R_𝐋^𝐆(λ) is a Hecke algebra attached to the group N_W(L)L, thus the dimension of the characters  of this group describe the multiplicities in the Harish-Chandra induced.\n\nSimilarly, when 𝐋 is a ζ-split Levi subgroup, and λ is a d-cuspidal unipotent  character of  𝐋 then  (conjecturally) the 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra  of the Lusztig induced R_𝐋^𝐆(λ)  is a cyclotomic Hecke algebra for  to the  group N_W(Lwϕλ)L.  The constituents  of R_𝐋^𝐆(λ) are called  a  ζ-Harish-Chandra  series.  In  the  case of rational groups or cosets,  corresponding to finite  reductive groups, the  conjugacy class of Lwϕ  depends  only  on  the  order  d  of  ζ,  so  one  also talks of d-Harish-Chandra  series. These series correspond to ℓ-blocks where l is  a prime divisor of Φ_d(q) which  does not divide any other cyclotomic factor of the order of 𝐆^F.\n\nThe functions described in this module allow to explore these situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"eigen.html#Gapjm.Eigenspaces.relative_degrees","page":"Eigenspaces","title":"Gapjm.Eigenspaces.relative_degrees","text":"relative_degrees(WF,d)\n\nLet  WF be a reflection group or a reflection coset.

The particular root  systems for Weyl groups play an important role in mathematics as they classify semi-simple Lie algebras and algebraic groups.\n\nLet  us give precise definitions.  Let V be a  real vector space and Vⱽ its  dual. A root system is a finite set of vectors R⊂ V (the roots), together  with  a  map  r↦  rⱽ  from  R  to  a subset Rⱽ of Vⱽ (the coroots) such that:\n\nFor any r∈ R,  we have rⱽ(r)=2, so  that the formula x↦ x-rⱽ(x)r defines  a  reflection  sᵣ:V→  V  with  root  r  and coroot rⱽ. \nThe reflection sᵣ stabilizes R.\n\nThe  subgroup W=W(R) of GL(V) generated by the reflections sᵣ for r∈ R  is a finite Coxeter  group. We require reduced  root systems, that is such  that the only elements of R colinear  with r∈ R are r and -r; for Weyl groups, we also require that the root system be crystallographic, that is rⱽ(s) is an integer, for any s∈ R,rⱽ∈ Rⱽ.\n\nIf  we identify  V with  Vⱽ by  choosing a  W-invariant bilinear form (.;.),  then we have rⱽ=2r/(r;r). A root system R is irreducible if R   is  not  the  union  of  two  orthogonal  subsets  (equivalently  the representation  of W on the subspace generated by R is irreducible). If R is reducible then the corresponding Coxeter group is the direct product of the Coxeter groups associated with the irreducible components of R.\n\nLet  us  now  describe  how  a  root  system  R and a presentation of the corresponding  W are encoded in  a Cartan matrix or  a Dynkin diagram. We can  choose  a  linear  form  on  V  which vanishes on no element of R. According to the sign of the value of this linear form on a root r ∈ R we call r positive or negative. Then there exists a unique subset Π of the  positive roots, the simple  roots, such that any  positive root is a linear  combination with non-negative coefficients of roots in Π. Any two sets of simple roots (corresponding to different choices of linear forms as above)  can be transformed into  each other by a  unique element of W(R). The  set S of reflections  with respect to the  simple roots is such that (W,S)  is  a  Coxeter  system.  These  generating  reflections are called Coxeter generators or simple reflections.\n\nSince the pairing between V and Vⱽ is W-invariant, if Π is a set of simple  roots and if we  define the Cartan matrix  as being the n times n  matrix C={rⱽ(r')}  for r,r'∈Π,  this matrix  is independent of the chosen  linear form  up to  simultaneous permutation  of rows  and columns. Since the action of sᵣ on r' for r,r'∈Π is given by sᵣ(r')=r'-C(r,r')r,   the   Cartan   matrix   determines  the  reflection representation of W.\n\nFor  a crystallographic root system the Cartan matrix has integral entries, and  in the basis Π (completed by a basis of the orthogonal), sᵣ has an integral  matrix.  All  finite-dimensional  (complex)  representations of a finite  Coxeter  group  can  be  realized  over  the field generated by the entries of the Cartan matrix.\n\nThe  Cartan matrix is encoded  in a Dynkin diagram,  a tree with weighted edges  and  an  orientation  on  edges  of  even weight >2, as follows. The vertices are in indexed by the simple reflections; an edge is drawn between s and t if the order mₛₜ of st is greater than 2 and is given the weight  mₛₜ. These  weights are  encoded by  drawing the  edge single for weight  3, double for weight 4 and triple for weight 6. The arrows indicate the relative root lengths (going from the longer to the shorter root) which may  differ between different orbits of  W on R. Alternately the Dynkin diagram  can be obtained  from the Cartan  matrix as follows:  if Cᵣₛ and Cₛᵣ  are integers  such that  |Cₛᵣ|≥|Cᵣₛ|=1 there  is an edge of weight |Cₛᵣ|  from r to s  with an arrow pointing  to s if |Cₛᵣ|>1. Note that  the Cartan matrices  we consider here  are not necessarily symmetric, contrary  to the  Cartan matrices  we considered  describing the reflection representation  of a general Coxeter  group; being symmetric corresponds to all roots being taken of the same length.\n\nThe  irreducible  crystallographic  root  systems  are  classified  by  the following  list of Dynkin diagrams. The labeling  of the nodes is the order of the generators and is shown by the function diagram.\n\nAₙ O—O—O—…—O   Bₙ O⇐ O—O—…—O  Cₙ O⇒ O—O—…—O  Dₙ O 2\n   1 2 3 … n      1  2 3 … n     1  2 3 … n     ￨\n                                              O—O—…—O\n                                              1 3 … n\n\nG₂ O⇛ O  F₄ O—O⇒O—O    E₆  O 2    E₇  O 2      E₈  O 2\n   1  2     1 2 3 4        ￨          ￨            ￨\n                       O—O—O—O—O  O—O—O—O—O—O  O—O—O—O—O—O—O\n                       1 3 4 5 6  1 3 4 5 6 7  1 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nWe get the Coxeter diagram, which describes the underlying Weyl group, if we  ignore  the  arrows:  we  see  that  the  root  systems B_n and C_n correspond to the same Coxeter group (the Coxeter diagram is defined by the Coxeter  matrix).

The  restriction of the simple reflections to the span of R is determined by the Cartan matrix, so R is determined by the Cartan matrix and the set of simple roots.\n\nThe function rootdatum takes as input a matrix r whose lines represents the  list  of  simple  roots  and  another  matrix cr whose lines are the corresponding  coroots  and  produces  a  FiniteCoxeterGroup  which  is a permutation  group containing in addition information about the root system R  and about W(R);  cr*transpose(r) should be  a Cartan matrix. If we label the positive roots by 1:N, and the negative roots by N+1:2N, then each simple reflection is represented by the permutation of 1:2N which it induces on the roots.\n\nIf a single matrix argument is given to rootdatum it is taken as cr and r  is taken  to be  the identity  matrix. If  one only wants to work with Cartan  matrices for irreducible  root systems, then rootdatum(cartan(t)) can be simplified to coxgroup(t).\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:D,4)\nD₄\n\njulia> cartan(W)\n4×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n  2   0  -1   0\n  0   2  -1   0\n -1  -1   2  -1\n  0   0  -1   2\n\nAlso,  the Weyl group struct associated to a direct sum of irreducible root systems can be obtained as a product\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,2)*coxgroup(:B,2)\nA₂×B₂\n\njulia> cartan(W)\n4×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n  2  -1   0   0\n -1   2   0   0\n  0   0   2  -2\n  0   0  -1   2\n\nThe  same object is constructed  by applying  rootdatum to  the matrix cat(cartan(:A,2), cartan(:B,2),dims=[1,2]).\n\nThe elements of a Weyl group are permutations of the roots:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:D,4)\nD₄\n\njulia> p=W(1,3,2,1,3)\n(1,14,13,2)(3,17,8,18)(4,12)(5,20,6,15)(7,10,11,9)(16,24)(19,22,23,21)\n\njulia> word(W,p)\n5-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 3\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\nfinally, a benchmark on julia 1.0.2\n\njulia> @btime length(elements(coxgroup(:E,7)))\n  531.385 ms (5945569 allocations: 1.08 GiB)\n\nGAP3 for the same computation takes 2.2s\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"weyl.html#Gapjm.PermRoot.cartan-Tuple{Symbol, Integer, Integer}","page":"Finite Coxeter groups and Weyl groups","title":"Gapjm.PermRoot.cartan","text":"cartan(type, rank [,bond])\n\nthe  Cartan matrix for a  finite Coxeter group described  by type and rank.

If  -uₛ₀uₛ₁ has a square  root  wₛ,  we  can  scale  the  basis  Tₛ  to  get  a new basis tₛ=-Tₛ/wₛ    with   quadratic    relations   (tₛ-vₛ)(tₛ+vₛ⁻¹)=0   where vₛ=wₛ/uₛ₁.   The  most  general  case   when  Kazhdan-Lusztig  bases  and polynomials  can be defined is when the parameters vₛ belong to a totally ordered abelian group Γ for multiplication, see Lusztig1983.  We set  Γ⁺= {γ∈  Γ∣γ>0} and Γ⁻={γ⁻¹∣γ∈ Γ⁺}={γ∈ Γ∣γ<0}.\n\nThus  we assume ℋ defined over the ring ℤ[Γ], the group algebra of Γ over  ℤ, and the quadratic  relations of ℋ  associate to each s∈ S a vₛ∈  Γ⁺ such that  (tₛ-vₛ)(tₛ+vₛ⁻¹)=0. We also  set qₛ=vₛ² and define the  basis Tₛ=vₛtₛ with quadratic relations (Tₛ-qₛ)(Tₛ+1)=0; for w∈ W with reduced expression w=s₁…sₙ we define q_w Γ by q_w^½=v_s₁v_sₙ and let q_w=(q_w^½)²; we have T_w=q_w^½t_w.\n\nWe  define the bar involution on ℋ  by linearity: on ℤ[Γ] we define it by  overline_γ Γa_γγ= _γ Γ a_γ γ¹ and we extend it to ℋ by  overline  Tₛ=Tₛ¹.  Then  the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis C^_w is defined  as  the  only  basis  of  ℋ  stable  by the bar involution and congruent to t_w modulo _w WΓt_w.\n\nThe  basis  C^_w  can  be  computed  as  follows.  We  define  elements R_xy  of ℤ[Γ] by  T_y¹=_x overlineR_xy¹ q_x¹T_x. We then  define inductively  the Kazhdan-Lusztig  polynomials (in this general context  we should say the Kazhdan-Lusztig elements of ℤ[Γ], which belong to the subalgebra of ℤ[Γ] generated by the qₛ) by P_xw=τ_(q_wq_x)^½  (_xywR_xyP_yw)  where  τ  is the truncation:  τ_nu _γ  Γ a_γγ=  _γnua_γγ; the  induction is thus on decreasing x for the Bruhat order and starts at P_ww=1. We have then C^_w=_y q_w^-12 P_ywT_y.\n\nThe  Chevie code  for the  Kazhdan-Lusztig bases  C, D and their primed versions, has been initially written by Andrew Mathas around 1994, who also contributed  to  the  design  of  the programs dealing with Kazhdan-Lusztig bases. He also implemented some other bases, such as the Murphy basis which we  also  implement.  The  code  for  the  unequal parameters case has been written  around  1999  by  F.Digne  and J.Michel. The other Kazhdan-Lusztig bases are computed in terms of the C′ basis.\n\nWhen  the ℤ[Γ] is a  Laurent polynomial ring the  bar operation is taking the  inverse of  the variables,  and truncation  is keeping terms of degree smaller or equal to that of ν. It is possible to use arbitrary groups Γ as   long   as   methods   bar:_γ   Γ   a_γγ  _γ  Γ  a_γγ¹, positive_part  : _γ  Γ a_γγ  _γ 1  a_γγ and negative_part: _γ  Γ  a_γγ    _γ  1  a_γγ  have been defined on ℤ[Γ]. These operations   will   be   used   internally   by  the  programs  to  compute Kazhdan-Lusztig bases.\n\nWe provide also functionality to study the Kazhdan-Lusztig left cells (for the equal-parameter Hecke algebra).\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:H,3)\nH₃\n\njulia> c=LeftCells(W)\n22-element Vector{LeftCell{FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Cyc{Int64}}}}:\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo= character=φ₁‚₀>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=123 character=φ₁‚₁₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(15) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(10) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(14) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=7 character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(12) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(9,12) character=φ₅‚₂>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(5,11) character=φ₅‚₂>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=13 character=φ₅‚₂>\n ⋮\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(8,13) character=φ₃‚₆+φ₃‚₈>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(1,15) character=φ₃‚₆+φ₃‚₈>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=3 character=φ₃‚₁+φ₃‚₃>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=2 character=φ₃‚₁+φ₃‚₃>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=1 character=φ₃‚₁+φ₃‚₃>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=6 character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(13) character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(11) character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=9 character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n\nsee  also  the  functions  elements,  character,  representation  and Wgraph  for left  cells.

One can first run  a number of standard checks on a given  pair  of  elements  to  see  if the computation of the corresponding polynomial  can be reduced to a similar computation for elements of smaller length.  One  such  check  involves  the  notion  of  critical  pairs  (see Alvis1987):  a pair  of elements  w₁,w₂∈ W  such that w₁≤w₂  is critical if ℒ(w₂)  ⊆ ℒ(w₁) and ℛ  (w₂)⊆ ℛ (w₁), where ℒ and ℛ denote the left and right descent set, respectively.

Iwahori-Hecke  algebras  in  this  last  case),  and  also  implements  the character  tables, Schur elements and representations of Hecke algebras for finite  groups. For Iwahori-Hecke algebras  and G(d,1,1) this module also implements  the standard basis (look  at the module KLfor Kazhdan-Lusztig bases).\n\nLet  (W,S) be a Coxeter system where mₛₜ is the order of st for s,t∈ S. Let R be a commutative ring with 1 and for s∈ S let uₛ₀,uₛ₁∈ R be elements which depend ony on the conjugacy class of s in W (this is the same  as requiring that uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ whenever mₛₜ is odd). The Iwahori-Hecke algebra of W over R with parameters uₛᵢ is a deformation of the group algebra  of W over R defined as  follows: it is the unitary associative R-algebra generated by elements Tₛ, s∈ S subject to the relations:\n\n(Tₛ-uₛ₀)(Tₛ-uₛ₁)=0 for all s∈ S (the quadratic relations)\n\nTₛTₜTₛ= TₜTₛTₜ with mₛₜ factors on each side (the braid relations)\n\nIf  uₛ₀=1 and  uₛ₁=-1 for  all s  then the quadratic relations become Tₛ²=1 and the deformation of the group algebra is trivial.\n\nSince  the generators Tₛ satisfy the  braid relations, the algebra H is in  fact a quotient of the group algebra of the braid group associated with W.  It follows that, if  w=s_1⋯ s_m is a  reduced expression of w ∈ W then  the product Tₛ_1⋯ Tₛ_m  depends only on w,  thus e will therefore denote  it by T_w. We have T_1=1;  if the uₛᵢ are indeterminates, the {T_w}_{w∈  W} form a basis of the  Hecke algebra which specializes to the canonical basis of the group algebra for uₛ₀↦1 and uₛ₁↦-1.\n\nIf  one of uₛ₀ or uₛ₁ is invertible  in R, for example uₛ₁, then by changing  the generators  to T′ₛ=-Tₛ/uₛ₁,  and setting qₛ=-uₛ₀/uₛ₁, the braid  relations do no change  (since when mₛₜ is  odd we have uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ) but  the quadratic relations become  (T′ₛ-qₛ)(T′ₛ+1)=0. This last form is the  most common  form considered  in the  literature. Another common form, considered  in  the  context  of  Kazhdan-Lusztig  theory, is uₛ₀=√qₛ and uₛ₁=-√qₛ⁻¹.  The  form  provided,  with  two parameters per generator, be useful in many contexts like constructing the Jones polynomial.\n\nFor  some  algebras  the  character  table,  and in general Kazhdan-Lusztig bases,  require a square root of -uₛ₀uₛ₁.  We provide a way to specify it with  the  field  .rootpara  which  can  be  provided  as  a keyword when constructing  the algebra. If not given,  a root is automatically extracted when needed by the function RootParameter. Note however that sometimes an explicit  choice of one of the two possible roots is necessary which cannot be automatically determined.\n\nThere  is a universal choice  for R and uₛᵢ:  Let uₛᵢ:s∈ S,i∈[0,1] be indeterminates   such  that  uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ  whenever  mₛₜ  is  odd,  and  let A=ℤ[uₛᵢ] be the corresponding polynomial ring. Then the Hecke algebra H of  W over a  with parameters uₛᵢ  is called the generic Iwahori-Hecke algebra  of  with  W.  Any  other  algebra  with parameters vₛᵢ can be obtained  by specialization from  H: There is  a unique ring homomorphism f:A  → R such that f(uₛᵢ)=vₛᵢ  for all i. Then we  can view R as an A-module via f and we can identify the other algebra to R _A H.\n\nThe  elements {T_w∣w∈ W} actually form an R-basis of H if for all s one  of the uₛᵢ is invertible. The  structure constants in that basis are obtained  as follows. To compute T_vT_w,  choose a reduced expression for v, say v=s_1 ⋯ s_k and apply inductively the formula:\n\nT_sT_w=T_sw               if l(sw)=l(w)+1\n\nT_sT_w=-uₛ₀uₛ₁T_sw+(uₛ₀+uₛ₁)T_w if l(sw)=l(w)-1.\n\nIf  for all s  we have uₛ₀=q,  uₛ₁=-1 then we  call the corresponding algebra the one-parameter or Spetsial Iwahori-Hecke algebra associated with W. Certain invariants  of the  irreducible characters  of this  algebra play a special role  in the representation theory of the underlying finite Coxeter groups, namely  the a- and A-invariants.  For basic properties of Iwahori-Hecke algebras  and their relevance to the representation theory of finite groups of Lie type, see for example Curtis and Reiner 1987, Sections~67 and 68.\n\nIn  the  following  example,  we  compute  the multiplication table for the 0-Iwahori–Hecke algebra associated with the Coxeter group of type A_2.\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,2)\nA₂\n\njulia> H=hecke(W,0)            # One-parameter algebra with `q=0`\nhecke(A₂,0)\n\njulia> T=Tbasis(H);            # Create the `T` basis\n\njulia> b=T.(elements(W))       # the basis\n6-element Vector{HeckeTElt{Perm{Int16}, Int64, HeckeAlgebra{Int64, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}}}:\n T.\n T₂\n T₁\n T₂₁\n T₁₂\n T₁₂₁\n\njulia> b*permutedims(b)       # multiplication table\n6×6 Matrix{HeckeTElt{Perm{Int16}, Int64, HeckeAlgebra{Int64, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}}}:\n T.

We will see that this also works on the level of characters and representations.\n\nFor  general complex reflection  groups, the picture  is similar. The Hecke algebras  are deformations  of the  group algebras,  generalizing those for real reflection groups.\n\nThe  definition is  as a  quotient of  the algebra  of the  braid group. We assume  now that W is  a finite reflection group  in the complex vector space  V. The braid group associated  is the fundamental group Π₁ of the  space  (V-bigcup_Hinmathcal H  H)W, where mathcal H is  the set of  reflecting hyperplanes of  W. This group  is generated by braid reflections, elements which by the natural map from the braid group to  the reflection  group project  to distinguished  reflections. The braid reflections   which  project  to  a  given  W-orbit  of  reflections  are conjugate.  Let 𝐬 be a representative of  such a conjugacy class of braid reflections,  let e  be the  order of  the image  of 𝐬  in W, and let u_𝐬0u_𝐬e-1 be indeterminates. The generic Hecke algebra is the ℤu_𝐬i^  1_𝐬i-algebra quotient of the  braid group algebra by the  relations  (𝐬-u_𝐬0)(𝐬-u_𝐬e-1)=0,  and  in  general an Hecke algebra  is any algebra obtained from  this generic algebra by specializing some of the parameters.\n\nThe  Hecke algebras  can be  explictely described  by a presentation of the braid  group. The braid group can  be presented by homogeneous relations in the   braid   reflections,   called   braid   relations,   described   in Broué-Malle-Rouquier     1998     and    Bessis-Michel 2003  (some were  obtained using  the VKCURVE  package of GAP3,  ported also  to Julia).  Further, these  presentations are such that the reflection  group  is  presented  by  the  same  relations,  plus relations describing  the  order  of  the  generating  reflections, called the order relations.  This  allows  to  define  the  Hecke algebra by a presentation similar  to  that  of  W,  with  the  same  braid relations but the order relations  replaced by a deformed version. \n\nIf  S⊂ W  is the  set of  distinguished reflections  of W which lift to generating  braid reflections 𝐬 in the braid group, we define the generic Hecke  algebra as follows: for each conjugacy  class of an s of order e we take indeterminates uₛ₀,…,uₛₑ₋₁, and consider the ℤuₛᵢ^1ₛᵢ-algebra  H  with  generators  T_s  for  each  s∈  S presented   by  the  braid  relations  and  the  deformed  order  relations (T_s-u_𝐬0)(T_s-u_𝐬e-1)=0.\n\nAriki,  Koike and Malle have computed the  character table of some of these algebras,  including  those  for  all  2-dimensional reflection groups, see Broué-Malle 1993 and Malle 1996; our data  has models of  all representation and  character tables for real reflection  groups; it  contains the  same for  imprimitive groups  and for primitive groups of dimension 2 and 3 (these last representations have been computed  in Malle-Michel 2010) and contains also models and  character tables computed by Michel  for G₂₉ and G₃₃; it constains also  partial lists of representations and partial character tables for the remaining groups G₃₁,G₃₂ and G₃₄, computed by Michel.\n\nThe quotient of the Hecke algebra obtained by specializing u_𝐬i ζₑⁱ is  isomorphic to the group algebra of W. It was conjectured for 20 years that  over a splitting ring  the Hecke algebra is  itself isomorphic to the group  algebra of  W over  the same  ring. This  was called  the freeness conjecture since the main problem is to show that the Hecke algebra is free of dimension |W|. This has finally been proved in 2019 thanks to the work of many people including Marin, Pfeiffer and Chavli for exceptional groups. Along  the way it has been proven that there exists a set {b_w}_{w∈ W} of elements  of the Braid group such that b_1=1 and b_w maps to w by the natural  quotient map,  such that  their images  T_w form  a basis of the Hecke algebra.\n\nIt  is  conjectured  that  such  a  basis  T_w  can  be  chosen such that additionnaly  the  linear  form  t  defined  by  t(T_w)=0 if w≠ 1 and t(1)=1 is a symmetrizing form for the symmetric algebra H. This is well known  for all real reflection groups  and has been proved in Malle-Mathas 1998   for   imprimitive   reflection   groups   and   in Malle-Michel 2010 for some primitive groups of dimension 2  and  3.  Chlouveraki  and  Chavli  have handled some other 2-dimensional cases.  For  each  irreducible  character  φ  of H we define the Schur element  Sᵩ associated to φ by the  condition that for any element T of  H we have t(T)=∑ᵩ φ(T)/Sᵩ. It  can be shown that the Schur elements are  Laurent polynomials, and they  do not depend on  the choice of a basis having  the above  property. Malle  has the  computed these Schur elements, assuming the above conjecture; they are in the Chevie data.\n\nSee the function hecke for various ways of specifying the parameters of a Hecke   algebra.

If no parameter is given, 1 is assumed which gives the group algebra of W.\n\nThe  following  forms  are  accepted  for  parameter: if parameter is a scalar,  it is  replaced by  fill(parameter,ngens(W)). If  it is a vector with   one  entry,  it   is  replaced  with  fill(parameter[1],ngens(W)). Otherwise,  parameter should be  a list of  length ngens(W). Entries of parameter  corresponding to  the same  W-orbit of  generators should be identical.\n\nFinally,  if parameter is a Tuple, the  tuple should have as many entry as  there are hyperplane  orbits in W  and each entry  will represent the parameter for the corresponding conjugacy class of braid reflections.\n\nAn  entry in  parameter for  a reflection  of order  e can  be either a single scalar value or a Vector of length 'e'. If it is a Vector, it is interpreted as the list [u₀,…,u_(e-1)] of parameters for that reflection.

I have implemented some other infrastructure which may become eventually separate packages:\n\nlinear algebra on any field/ring (module GLinearAlgebra)\nposets (module Posets)\ncyclotomic polynomials (module CycPols)\nsigned permutations (module SPerms)\nfinite fields (module FFields)\nInteger matrices and lattices (module MatInt)\n\nfor  permutation groups I have  often replaced the sophisticated algorithms of  GAP by naive but  easy to write methods  only suitable for small groups (sufficient  for the  rest of  the package  but maybe  not for your needs). Otherwise  the  code  for  infrastructure  is  often  competitive with GAP, despite  being much shorter (often 100 lines of Julia replace 1000 lines of C); I am sure there are more optimisations possible. Any comments about the code and the design are welcome. For functions which are too inefficient or difficult  to implement (like character tables of arbitrary groups) Gapjm automatically calls GAP4 if you did using GAP.\n\nThe  package Gapjm contains currently  about 90% of Chevie functionality, ported  from Gap3. The function gap  can help you discover the equivalent functionality  to a Gap3  function: it takes  a string and  gives you Julia translations of functions in Gap3 which match this string.\n\njulia> gap(\"words\")\nCharRepresentationWords  =>  traces_words_mats\nCoxeterWords(W[,l])      =>  word.(Ref(W),elements(W[,l]))\nGarsideWords             =>  elements\n\nThen you can call on-line help on the discovered functions.\n\nThe  port to Julia is not complete in the sense that 80% of the code is the data library of Chevie, which has been automatically ported by a transpiler so  its  code  is  \"strange\".  When  the  need  to  maintain  both versions simultaneously subsides, I will do a proper translation of the data library.\n\nOtherwise  the  code  in  this  package  is  often 10 times faster than the equivalent GAP3 Chevie code (after the maddeningly long compilation time on first execution –- the TTFP problem of Julia).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"index.html#Extensions-to-Laurent-and-Puiseux-polynomials","page":"Gapjm","title":"Extensions to Laurent and Puiseux polynomials","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Gapjm","title":"Gapjm","text":"factor(::Pol{FFE{p}}where p, F)\nFact.factor(f::Pol{var\"#s162\"} where var\"#s162\"<:Union{Integer, Rational})\nfactor(p::Mvp{T, N}) where {T, N}","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Primes.factor-Tuple{Pol{FFE{p}} where p, Any}","page":"Gapjm","title":"Primes.factor","text":"factor(f::Pol{FFE{p}}[, F])\n\nGiven  f a polynomial  over a finite  field of characteristic p, factor f,  by default over the  field of its coefficients,  or if specified over the field F.\n\njulia> @Pol q\nPol{Int64}: q\n\njulia> f=(q^4-1)*Z(3)^0\nPol{FFE{3}}: q⁴-1\n\njulia> factor(f)\n3-element Vector{Pol{FFE{3}}}:\n q²+1\n q+1\n q-1\n\njulia> factor(f,GF(9))\n4-element Vector{Pol{FFE{3}}}:\n q+1\n q-1\n q+Z₉²\n q+Z₉⁶\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"index.html#Primes.factor-Tuple{Pol{<:Union{Integer, Rational}}}","page":"Gapjm","title":"Primes.factor","text":"factor(f::Pol{<:Union{Integer,Rational}})\n\nFactor over the integers a polynomial with integral coefficients, or do the same over the rationals.\n\njulia> factor(Pol(:q)^24-1)\n8-element Vector{Pol{BigInt}}:\n q-1\n q²-q+1\n q⁴-q²+1\n q⁸-q⁴+1\n q⁴+1\n q²+1\n q+1\n q²+q+1\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"index.html#Primes.factor-Union{Tuple{Mvp{T, N}}, Tuple{N}, Tuple{T}} where {T, N}","page":"Gapjm","title":"Primes.factor","text":"factor(p::Mvp)\n\np  should be of degree <=2 thus represents a quadratic form.
