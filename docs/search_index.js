I started  this project  at the  end of 2018 and it is still  in flux so  the package is  not yet registered.  If you see anything that needs improving in this package, please contact me or make an issue or pull request in the GitHub repository.\n\nInstalling\n\nTo install this package, at the Julia command line:\n\nenter package mode with ]\ndo the command\n\n(@v1.7) pkg> add \"https://github.com/jmichel7/Gapjm.jl\"\n\nexit package mode with backspace and then do\n\njulia> using Gapjm\n\nand you are set up.\n\nTo update later to the latest version, do\n\n(@v1.7) pkg> update Gapjm\n\nThis package requires julia 1.6 or later. \n\nI  have implemented the  GAP functionality (infrastructure)  needed to make Chevie  work.  I  have  already  registered  most of this infrastructure as separate packages; the following packages are loaded and reexported so that their  functionality is  automatically available  when you  use Gapjm. In other terms, Gapjm is a meta-package for the following packages:\n\n(univariate) LaurentPolynomials (and rational fractions)\n(multivariate) PuiseuxPolynomials (and rational fractions when there are no fractional exponents)\nCyclotomicNumbers\nModuleElts (elements of a free module over some ring)\nCombinat (combinatorics and some basic number theory)\nPermGroups (permutations, groups, permutations groups. It contains the modules Perms and Groups which could be separate packages)\nSignedPerms (signed permutations)\nMatInt (Integer matrices and lattices)\nCycPols (cyclotomic polynomials)\nGenLinearAlgebra (linear algebra on any field/ring)\nFinitePosets (finite posets)\nFiniteFields (finite fields)\n\nLook  at the  documentation of  the above  packages to  see how  to use the corresponding  features. I have implemented  some more infrastructure which sits currently in Gapjm but may become eventually separate packages:\n\npresentations of groups, and groups defined by generators and relations (module Presentations)\nfactorizing polynomials over finite fields (module FFfac)\nfactorizing polynomials over the rationals (module Fact)\nNumber fields which are subfields of the Cyclotomics (module Nf)\n\nfor permutation groups I have often replaced GAP's sophisticated algorithms with  naive  but  easy-to-write  methods  suitable  only  for  small groups (sufficient  for the  rest of  the package  but maybe  not for your needs). Otherwise  the infrastructure code  is often competitive  with GAP, despite being much shorter (often 100 lines of Julia replace 1000 lines of C); I am sure  there are more  optimisations possible. Any  comments on the code and the design are welcome. For functions that are too inefficient or difficult to  implement  (such  as  character  tables  of  arbitrary  groups) Gapjm automatically calls GAP4 if you did using GAP. Otherwise the code in this package  is  often  10  times  faster  than the equivalent GAP3 Chevie code (after  the maddeningly  long compilation  time on  first execution –- the TTFP problem of Julia).\n\nThe   Gapjm  package   currently  contains   about  90%   of  the  Chevie functionality,  ported from Gap3.  The gap function  can help you to find the  equivalent functionality  to a  Gap3 function:  it takes  a string and gives you Julia translations of functions in Gap3 that match that string.\n\njulia> gap(\"words\")\nCharRepresentationWords  =>  traces_words_mats\nCoxeterWords(W[,l])      =>  word.(Ref(W),elements(W[,l]))\nGarsideWords             =>  elements\n\nThen you can call on-line help on the discovered functions.\n\nThe  port to Julia is not complete in the sense that 80% of the code is the data library from Chevie, which was automatically ported by a transpiler so its code is \"strange\". When the need to maintain the GAP3 version and the Julia  version simultaneously subsides, I will do a proper translation of the data library, which should give an additional speed boost.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"index.html#Extensions-to-Laurent-and-Puiseux-polynomials","page":"Gapjm","title":"Extensions to Laurent and Puiseux polynomials","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Gapjm","title":"Gapjm","text":"FFfac\nfactor(::Pol{FFE{p}}where p, F)\nFact\nFact.factor(f::Pol{var\"#s162\"} where var\"#s162\"<:Union{Integer, Rational})\nfactor(p::Mvp{T, N}) where {T, N}","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Gapjm.FFfac","page":"Gapjm","title":"Gapjm.FFfac","text":"Factoring polynomials over finite fields\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"index.html#Primes.factor-Tuple{Pol{FFE{p}} where p, Any}","page":"Gapjm","title":"Primes.factor","text":"factor(f::Pol{FFE{p}}[, F])\n\nGiven  f a polynomial  over a finite  field of characteristic p, factor f,  by default over the  field of its coefficients,  or if specified over the field F.

Let 𝐓 be a maximal torus of 𝐆, let X(𝐓)  be the  character group  of 𝐓  (resp. Y(𝐓)  the dual lattice of one-parameter  subgroups  of  𝐓)  and  Φ  (resp  Φ^) the roots (resp. coroots) of 𝐆 with respect to 𝐓.\n\nThen  𝐆 is  determined up  to isomorphism  by the  root datum (X(𝐓),Φ, Y(𝐓),Φ^).  In algebraic terms, this consists  in giving a free ℤ-lattice X=X(𝐓) of dimension the rank of 𝐓 (which is also called the rank of 𝐆),  and a root system Φ ⊂ X,  and giving similarly the dual roots Φ^⊂ Y=Y(𝐓).\n\nThis  is obtained  by a  slight generalization  of our  setup for a Coxeter group  W. This time we assume the canonical basis of the vector space V on  which W acts is a ℤ-basis of  X, and Φ is specified by a matrix simpleroots(W)  whose lines are the simple  roots expressed in this basis of  X. Similarly Φ^  is described by  a matrix simplecoroots(W) whose lines  are the simple coroots in the basis  of Y dual to the chosen basis of  X. The duality pairing between X and Y is the canonical one, that is   the  pairing  between  vectors   x∈  X  and  y∈   Y  is  given  by transpose(x)*y. Thus, we must have the relation simpleroots(W)*transpose(simplecoroots(W))=cartan(W).\n\nWe  get that  by a  the function  rootdatum, whose  arguments are the two matrices simpleroots(W) and simplecoroots(W) described above. The roots need  not generate V, so  the matrices need not  be square. For instance, the root datum of the linear group of rank 3 can be specified as:\n\njulia> W=rootdatum([-1 1 0;0 -1 1],[-1 1 0;0 -1 1])\nA₂Φ₁\n\njulia> reflrep(W,W(1))\n3×3 Matrix{Int64}:\n 0  1  0\n 1  0  0\n 0  0  1\n\nhere  the symmetric group on 3 letters  acts by permutation of the basis of X.  The dimension of X (size(simpleroots(W),2)) is the rank and the dimension of the subspace generated by the roots (size(simpleroots(W),1)) is  called the  semi-simple rank.  In the  example the  rank is 3 and the semisimple rank is 2.\n\nThe  default form  W=coxgroup(:A,2) defines  the adjoint  algebraic group (the  group with a trivial center). In that  case Φ is a basis of X, so simpleroots(W)  is  the  identity  matrix  and  simplecoroots(W) is the Cartan  matrix cartan(W) of the root system.\n\nThe   form  coxgroup(:A,2,sc=true)   constructs  the   semisimple  simply connected  algebraic  group,  where  simpleroots(W)  is the transposed of cartan(W) and simplecoroots(W) is the identity matrix.\n\nThere  is an extreme form  of root data which  requires another function to specify:  when W is the trivial coxgroup()  and there are thus no roots (in  this case  𝐆  is a  torus), the  root datum  has no  roots, thus is entirely  determined by  the rank  r. The  function torus(r) constructs such a root datum.\n\nFinally,  the function rootdatum also understands some familiar names for the algebraic groups and gives the results that could be obtained by giving the appropriate matrices simpleroots(W) and simplecoroots(W):\n\njulia> rootdatum(:gl,3)   # same as the previous example\ngl₃\n\nThe known types of root data are  :gl, :pgl, :sl, :slmod, :tgl :sp, :csp, :psp, :so, :pso, :cso, :halfspin,    :gpin, :spin, :E6, :E6sc, :CE6, :E7, :E7sc, :CE7, :E8, :F4, :G2.\n\nSemisimple elements\n\nIt  is possible to compute  with semi-simple elements; there  are 2 type of them.  The  first  type  are  finite  order  elements of 𝐓, which over an algebraically  closed field K are in bijection with elements of Y⊗ ℚ /ℤ whose  denominator  is  prime  to  the  characteristic  of  K.  These are represented  as a vector of Rationals r such that 0≤r<1. The function ss  constructs such  a semisimple  element from  a vector of Rationals. More  generally 𝐓 is isomorphic to (Kˣ)^n where n is the dimension of 𝐓, so a vector of elements of Kˣ is a more general representation which is   given  by  the  function   SemisimplElement;  in  this  setting  the representation given by ss is naturally interpreted as a Vector{Root1}.\n\njulia> G=rootdatum(:sl,4)\nsl₄\n\njulia> ss(G,[1//3,1//4,3//4,2//3])\nSemisimpleElement{Root1}: <ζ₃,ζ₄,ζ₄³,ζ₃²>\n\njulia> SemisimpleElement(G,[E(3),E(4),E(4,3),E(3,2)])\nSemisimpleElement{Root1}: <ζ₃,ζ₄,ζ₄³,ζ₃²>\n\njulia> L=reflection_subgroup(G,[1,3])\nA₃₍₁₃₎=A₁×A₁Φ₁\n\njulia> C=algebraic_center(L)\n(Z0 = SubTorus(A₃₍₁₃₎=A₁×A₁Φ₁,[1 2 1]), AZ = Group(SemisimpleElement{Root1}[<1,1,-1>]), descAZ = [[1, 2]], ZD = Group(SemisimpleElement{Root1}[<-1,1,1>, <1,1,-1>]))\n\njulia> T=torsion_subgroup(C.Z0,3)\nGroup(SemisimpleElement{Root1}[<ζ₃,ζ₃²,ζ₃>])\n\njulia> e=sort(elements(T))\n3-element Vector{SemisimpleElement{Root1}}:\n <1,1,1>\n <ζ₃,ζ₃²,ζ₃>\n <ζ₃²,ζ₃,ζ₃²>\n\nIn  the above, the Levi subgroup  L of SL₄ consisting of block-diagonal matrices  of shape  2×2 is  constructed.

The unipotent  classes depend on the characteristic of k; their classification differs when the characteristic is  not good  (that is,  when it  divides one  of the coefficients of the highest  root).  In  good  characteristic,  the  unipotent  classes  are in bijection with nilpotent orbits on the Lie algebra.\n\nWe  give  the  following  information  for  a unipotent element u of each class:\n\nthe centralizer C_𝐆 (u), that we describe by the reductive part of C_𝐆  (u)^0, by the  group of components  A(u)=C_𝐆 (u)C_𝐆 (u)^0, and by the dimension of its radical.\nin good characteristic, the  Dynkin-Richardson  diagram.\nthe Springer correspondence,  attaching characters of  the Weyl group or relative Weyl groups to each character of A(u).\n\nThe  Dynkin-Richarson diagram is  attached to a  nilpotent element e of the  Lie algebra  𝔤. By  the Jacobson-Morozov  theorem there  exists an 𝔰𝔩₂ subalgebra of 𝔤 containing e as the element beginpmatrix1001  endpmatrix.  Let  𝐒  be  the  torus beginpmatrixh00h^-1 endpmatrix of SL₂ and let 𝐓 be  a  maximal  torus  containing  𝐒,  so  that 𝐒 is the image of a one-parameter   subgroup  σ  Y(𝐓).  Consider  the  root  decomposition 𝔤=_αΣ𝔤_α  given by 𝐓; then ασα defines a linear form on Σ,  determined by its value on simple roots. It is possible to choose a system  of simple roots  Π so that  σα 0 for  αΠ, and then σα012 for any αΠ. The Dynkin diagram of Π decorated by these  values 012 is  called the Dynkin-Richardson  diagram of e, and in good characteristic is a complete invariant of its 𝔤-orbit.\n\nLet  ℬ be  the variety  of all  Borel subgroups  and let  ℬᵤ be the subvariety  of Borel subgroups  containing the unipotent  element u. Then dim C_𝐆(u)=rank 𝐆 + 2 dim ℬ_u and in good characteristic this dimension can  be computed from  the Dynkin-Richardson diagram:  the dimension of the class of u is the number of roots α such that σα01.\n\nWe   describe  now  the  Springer  correspondence.  Indecomposable  locally constant  𝐆-equivariant sheaves  on C,  called local systems, are parameterized   by  irreducible  characters  of  A(u).  The  ordinary Springer  correspondence is  a bijection  between irreducible characters of the  Weyl group and a large subset  of the local systems which contains all trivial  local  systems  (those  parameterized  by the trivial character of A(u)  for  each  u).  More  generally,  the  generalized Springer correspondence   associates  to   each  local   system  a   (unique  up  to 𝐆-conjugacy)  cuspidal pair of  a Levi subgroup  𝐋 of 𝐆 and a cuspidal  local system on an unipotent class  of 𝐋, such that the set of  local systems associated  to a given  cuspidal pair is parameterized by the characters of the relative Weyl group W_𝐆 (𝐋)=N_𝐆 (𝐋)𝐋. There are only few cuspidal pairs.\n\nThe  Springer correspondence gives information on the character values of a finite  reductive groups  as follows:  assume that  k is  the algebraic closure  of a finite field 𝔽_q and that F is the Frobenius attached to  an 𝔽_q-structure of  𝐆. Let C  be an F-stable unipotent class  and let u C^F; we call C the geometric class of u and the 𝐆^F-classes inside C^F are parameterized by the F-conjugacy classes  of A(u), denoted H¹(FA(u)) (most  of the time we can find u such that F acts trivially on A(u) and H¹(FA(u)) is then just the conjugacy classes). To an F-stable character φ of A(u) we  associate  the  characteristic  function  of  the corresponding local system (actually associated to an extension φ of φ to A(u)F); it  is a class function  Y_uφ on 𝐆^F which  can be normalized so that:  Y_uφ(u₁)=φ(cF) if u₁ is geometrically conjugate to u and  its 𝐆^F-class is parameterized by the F-conjugacy class cF of  A(u), otherwise Y_uφ(u₁)=0. If  the pair uφ corresponds via  the Springer correspondence to the character χ of W_𝐆(𝐋), then Y_uφ  is also  denoted Yᵪ.  There is  another important class of functions  indexed by local  systems: to a  local system on  class C is attached  an intersection cohomology complex, which is a complex of sheaves supported on the closure C. To such a complex of sheaves is associated its  characteristic  function,  a  class  function of 𝐆^F obtained by taking  the alternating trace of the Frobenius  acting on the stalks of the cohomology  sheaves. If Y_ψ  is the characteristic  function of a local system,  the  characteristic  function  of  the  corresponding intersection cohomology  complex is  denoted by  X_ψ. This  function is supported on C,  and Lusztig has shown that X_ψ=ᵩ P_ψχ Yᵪ where P_ψχ are  integer polynomials in q and  Yᵪ are attached to local systems on classes lying in C.\n\nLusztig   and  Shoji  have  given  an   algorithm  to  compute  the  matrix P_ψχ,   which  is  implemented  in  Chevie.  The  relationship  with characters   of  𝐆(𝔽_q),  taking  to  simplify  the  ordinary  Springer correspondence,  is that the  restriction to the  unipotent elements of the almost  character R_χ is equal to  q^bᵪ Xᵪ, where bᵪ is dim ℬᵤ  for an element u of  the class C such that  the support of χ is C.  The restriction of  the Deligne-Lusztig characters  R_w to the unipotents  are called  the Green  functions and  can also be computed by Chevie.  The values of  all unipotent characters  on unipotent elements can also  be  computed  in  principle  by  applying Lusztig's Fourier transform matrix (see the section on the Fourier matrix) but there is a difficulty in that  the Xᵪ must be first multiplied  by some roots of unity which are not  known in all cases (and when  known may depend on the congruence class of q modulo some small primes).\n\nWe illustrate these computations on some examples:\n\njulia> UnipotentClasses(rootdatum(:sl,4))\nUnipotentClasses(sl₄)\n1111<211<22<31<4\n   u│D-R dBu B-C          C(u) A₃(A₃₍₎=Φ₁³) A₁(A₃₍₁₃₎=A₁×A₁Φ₁)/-1 .(A₃)/ζ₄\n────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4   │222   0 222         q³.Z₄          1:4                  -1:2    ζ₄:Id\n31  │202   1 22.    q⁴.A₁₍₎=Φ₁        Id:31                               \n22  │020   2 2.2      q⁴.A₁.Z₂         2:22                 11:11         \n211 │101   3 2.. q⁵.A₂₍₁₎=A₁Φ₁       Id:211                               \n1111│000   6 ...

The partial order on unipotent  classes given by Zariski closure  is given before the table. The column   D-R,   displayed   only   in   good  characteristic,  gives  the Dynkin-Richardson  diagram  for  each  class;  the  column  dBu gives the dimension  of the variety  ℬ ᵤ. The  column B-C gives the Bala-Carter classification  of u, that is in the  case of sl₄ it displays u as  a regular unipotent in a  Levi subgroup by giving the Dynkin-Richardson diagram  of a regular  unipotent (all 2's)  at entries corresponding to the Levi  and . at  entries which do  not correspond to  the Levi. The column C(u)  describes the group  C_𝐆(u): a power  qᵈ describes that the unipotent  radical of C_𝐆(u) has  dimension d (thus qᵈ rational points);  then follows a  description of the  reductive part of the neutral component  of C_𝐆(u),  given by  the name  of its  root datum.  Then if C_𝐆(u)  is not  connected, the  description of  A(u) is given using another  vocabulary: a  cyclic group  of order  4 is  given as  Z4, and a symmetric group on 3 points would be given as S3.\n\nFor  instance, the first class 4  has C_𝐆(u)^0 unipotent of dimension 3 and A(u) equal to Z4, the cyclic group of order 4. The class 22 has  C_G(u) with unipotent radical of  dimension 4, reductive part of type  A1 and A(u) is  Z2, that is the  cyclic group of order 2. The other  classes have C_𝐆(u) connected. For  the class 31 the reductive part of C_G(u) is a torus of rank 1.\n\nThen  there is one column for each Springer series, giving for each class the  pairs  'a:b'  where  'a'  is  the  name  of  the character of A(u) describing  the local system involved and 'b'  is the name of the character of  the (relative) Weyl group corresponding by the Springer correspondence. At  the top of the  column is written the  name of the relative Weyl group, and  in brackets the  name of the  Levi affording a  cuspidal local system; next,  separated  by  a  /  is  a  description  of  the central character associated  to the  Springer series  (omitted if  this central character is trivial):   all  local  systems  in  a  given  Springer  series  have  same restriction  to the center of  𝐆. To find what  the picture becomes for another algebraic group in the same isogeny class, for instance the adjoint group,  one  simply  discards  the  Springer series whose central character becomes  trivial on the center of 𝐆;  and each group A(u) has to be quotiented  by the common  kernel of the  remaining characters. Here is the table for the adjoint group:\n\njulia> UnipotentClasses(coxgroup(:A,3))\nUnipotentClasses(A₃)\n1111<211<22<31<4\n   u│D-R dBu B-C          C(u) A₃(A₃₍₎=Φ₁³)\n────┼───────────────────────────────────────\n4   │222   0 222            q³         Id:4\n31  │202   1 22.    q⁴.A₁₍₎=Φ₁        Id:31\n22  │020   2 2.2         q⁴.A₁        Id:22\n211 │101   3 2.. q⁵.A₂₍₁₎=A₁Φ₁       Id:211\n1111│000   6 ...

G₂         Id:φ₁‚₆       \n\nwhich illustrates that on class G₂(a₁) there are two local systems in the principal  series of  the Springer  correspondence, and  a further cuspidal local system. Also, from the B-C column, we see that that class is not in a  proper Levi,  in which  case the  Bala-Carter diagram coincides with the Dynkin-Richardson diagram.\n\nThe  characteristics 2 and  3 are not  good for G2.

For each irreducible  group the character  table is either  computed using recursive formulas  for the infinite series,  or read into the  system from a library file  for the  exceptional types.  Thus, character  tables can  be obtained quickly  even for very large groups  (e.g., E₈). Similar remarks apply for conjugacy classes.\n\nThe  conjugacy  classes  and  irreducible  characters of irreducible finite complex reflection groups have canonical labelings by certain combinatorial objects;  these labelings are used in the  tables we give. For the classes, these  are partitions or partition tuples  for the infinite series, or, for exceptional  Coxeter  groups,  Carter's  admissible  diagrams Carter1972; for other  primitive  complex  reflection  groups  we  just  use  words  in the generators  to specify  the classes.

This information is given by the functions classinfo  and  charinfo.  When  you  display  the character table, the canonical labelings for classes and characters are displayed.\n\nA  typical example  is coxgroup(:A,n),  the symmetric  group 𝔖ₙ₊₁ where classes  and characters are  parameterized by partitions  of n+1 (this is also the case for coxsym(n+1)).\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,3)\nA₃\n\njulia> CharTable(W)\nCharTable(A₃)\n    │1111 211 22 31  4\n────┼──────────────────\n1111│   1  -1  1  1 -1\n211 │   3  -1 -1  .  1\n22  │   2   .  2 -1  .\n31  │   3   1 -1  . -1\n4   │   1   1  1  1  1\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)\nG₂\n\njulia> ct=CharTable(W)\nCharTable(G₂)\n     │A₀ Ã₁ A₁ G₂ A₂ A₁+Ã₁\n─────┼─────────────────────\nφ₁‚₀ │ 1  1  1  1  1     1\nφ₁‚₆ │ 1 -1 -1  1  1     1\nφ′₁‚₃│ 1  1 -1 -1  1    -1\nφ″₁‚₃│ 1 -1  1 -1  1    -1\nφ₂‚₁ │ 2  .  .  1 -1    -2\nφ₂‚₂ │ 2  .  . -1 -1     2\n\njulia> ct.charnames\n6-element Vector{String}:\n \"\\phi_{1,0}\"\n \"\\phi_{1,6}\"\n \"\\phi_{1,3}'\"\n \"\\phi_{1,3}''\"\n \"\\phi_{2,1}\"\n \"\\phi_{2,2}\"\n\njulia> ct.classnames\n6-element Vector{String}:\n \"A_0\"\n \"\\tilde A_1\"\n \"A_1\"\n \"G_2\"\n \"A_2\"\n \"A_1+\\tilde A_1\"\n\nReflection  groups  have  fake  degrees  (see fakedegrees), whose valuation and degree give two integers b,B for each irreducible character of  W. For  spetsial groups  (which include  finite Coxeter  groups), the valuation  and degree of the generic degrees  of the Hecke algebra give two more integers a,A (for Coxeter groups see Carter1985, Ch.11 for more details). These integers are also used in the  operations of  truncated induction,  see j_induction_table and J_induction_table.\n\nIwahori-Hecke  algebras and  cyclotomic Hecke  algebras also have character tables, see the corresponding chapters.\n\nWe  now describe for each type our conventions for labeling the classes and characters.\n\nType  Aₙ  (n≥0).  In  this  case  we  have  W ≅ 𝔖ₙ₊₁. The classes and characters  are labelled by partitions of  n+1. The partition labelling a class  is the cycle type of the  elements in that class; the representative in  '.classtext' is  the concatenation  of the  words corresponding to each part,  where the word for a part  i is  the  product of i-1 consecutive generators  (starting  one  higher  than  the  last  generator used for the previous  parts). The partition labelling a character describes the type of the  Young  subgroup  such  that  the  trivial  character induced from this subgroup  contains that character with multiplicity 1 and such that every other character occurring in this induced character has a higher a-value. Thus,  the sign  character is  labelled by  the partition  (1ⁿ⁺¹) and the trivial character by the partition (n+1). The character of the reflection representation of W is labelled by (n,1).\n\nType  Bₙ  (n≥2).  In  this  case  W=W(Bₙ) is isomorphic to the wreath product  of the cyclic  group of order  2 with the  symmetric group 𝔖ₙ. Hence  the classes and characters are  parameterized by pairs of partitions such  that the total sum of their  parts equals n. The pair corresponding to  a class describes the signed cycle type for the elements in that class, as in Carter1972. We use the convention that if (λ,μ) is such a pair then λ corresponds to the positive and μ to the negative cycles.  Thus, (1ⁿ,-) and  (-,1ⁿ) label respectively  the trivial class and  the  class  of  the  longest  element.\n\nThe  pair  corresponding  to  an  irreducible  character  is determined via Clifford  theory, as  follows. We  have a  semidirect product decomposition W(Bₙ)=N  ⋊  𝔖ₙ  where  N  is  the standard n-dimensional 𝔽₂ⁿ-vector space.  For a,b ≥ 0 such that  n=a+b let η_ab be the irreducible character  of N  which takes  value 1  on the  first a standard basis vectors  and value -1 on the last b standard basis vectors of N. Then the  inertia subgroup of η_ab has the form T_ab=N(𝔖_a  𝔖_b) and  we  can  extend  η_ab  trivially  to  an  irreducible character η_ab  of T_ab. Let α and β be partitions of a and b, respectively.  We take the tensor  product of the corresponding irreducible characters  of 𝔖_a and 𝔖_b and  regard this as an irreducible character of  T_ab. Multiplying this character  with η_ab and inducing to  W(Bₙ) yields  an irreducible  character χ=  χ_(αβ) of W(Bₙ). This defines the correspondence between irreducible characters and pairs of partitions as above.\n\nFor example, the pair ((n),-) labels the trivial character and (-,(1ⁿ)) labels  the  sign  character.  The  character  of  the  natural  reflection representation is labeled by ((n-1),(1)).\n\nType  Dₙ (n≥4). In this case W=W(Dₙ) can be embedded as a subgroup of index  2 into the Coxeter  group W(Bₙ). The intersection  of a class of W(Bₙ) with W(Dₙ) is either empty or a single class in W(Dₙ) or splits up  into two classes in  W(Dₙ). This also leads  to a parameterization of the  classes of W(Dₙ) by pairs of  partitions (λ,μ) as before but where the  number of parts of μ is even and where there are two classes of this type  if μ is empty and all parts of  λ are even. In the latter case we denote  the two classes in W(Dₙ) by (λ,+) and (λ,-), where we use the convention  that  the  class  labeled  by (λ,+) contains a representative which  can be written  as a word  in {s₁,s₃,…,sₙ} and  (λ,-) contains a representative which can be written as a word in {s₂,s₃, …,sₙ}.\n\nBy  Clifford theory the restriction of  an irreducible character of W(Bₙ) to  W(Dₙ)  is  either  irreducible  or  splits  up  into  two irreducible components.  Let (α,β) be  a pair of  partitions with total  sum of parts equal to n. If α!=β then the restrictions of the irreducible characters of  W(Bₙ) labeled  by (α,β)  and (β,α)  are irreducible and equal. If α=β  then the restriction of the character labeled by (α,α) splits into two  irreducible components  which we  denote by  (α,+) and (α,-). Note that  this can only happen if n is  even. In order to fix the notation we use  a  result  of  Stembridge1989  which describes the value  of the  difference of  these two  characters on  a class of the form (λ,+)  in terms of the character values of the symmetric group 𝔖_{n/2}. Recall  that it is implicit  in the notation (λ,+)  that all parts of λ are even. Let λ' be the partition of n/2 obtained by dividing each part by  2. Then the value of χ_{(α,-)}-χ_{(α,+)} on an element in the class (λ,+) is given by 2^{k(λ)} times the value of the irreducible character of  𝔖_{n/2} labeled by α on the class of cycle type λ'. (Here, k(λ) denotes the number of non-zero parts of λ.)\n\nThe  labels for the trivial, the  sign and the natural reflection character are the same as for W(Bₙ), since these characters are restrictions of the corresponding characters of W(Bₙ).\n\nThe groups G(d,1,n). They  are isomorphic to the wreath product of the cyclic group of order d with  the  symmetric  group  𝔖ₙ.  Hence  the  classes  and characters are parameterized  by d-tuples of partitions such that the total sum of their parts  equals n. The words chosen  as representatives of the classes are, when d>2, computed in a slightly different way than for Bₙ, in order to agree  with the words on which Ram  and Halverson compute the characters of the  Hecke algebra. First the parts of the d partitions are merged in one big  partition and sorted in  increasing order. Then, to  a part i coming from  the j-th partition is  associated the word (l+1…1… l+1)ʲ⁻¹l+2…l+i where l is the highest generator used to express the previous part.\n\nThe  d-tuple corresponding to an  irreducible character is determined via Clifford  theory in  a similar  way than  for the  Bₙ case.  The identity character  has the first  partition with one  part equal n  and the other ones  empty. The character of the  reflection representations has the first two  partitions with one part  equal respectively to n-1  and to 1, and the other partitions empty.\n\nThe groups G(de,e,n). They  are normal  subgroups of  index e  in G(de,1,n).  The quotient is cyclic,  generated by the image g  of the first generator of G(de,1,n). The  classes are parameterized as the  classes of G(de,e,n) with an extra information for a component of a class which splits.\n\nAccording  to  Hugues1985,  a  class  C of G(de,1,n) parameterized  by a de-partition (S₀S_de-1) is in G(de,e,n) if e  divides ᵢ i _p Sᵢp. It  splits in d classes for the largest d  dividing e and all parts of all  Sᵢ and such that Sᵢ is empty if d  does not divide i. If w is in C then 'gⁱ w g⁻ⁱ' for 'i in 0:d-1' are  representatives of the classes of G(de,e,n) which meet C. They are described by appending the integer i to the label for C.\n\nThe  characters are described by Clifford theory. We make g act on labels for  characters of G(de,1,n)  . The action  of g permutes circularly by d  the partitions in the de-tuple.  A character has same restriction to G(de,e,n)  as its transform by g.  The number of irreducible components of its restriction is equal to the order k of its stabilizer under powers of  g.  We  encode  a  character  of  G(de,e,n)  by first, choosing the smallest  for lexicographical order label  of a character whose restriction contains  it; then this label is periodic with a motive repeated k times; we  represent the  character by  one of  these motives,  to which we append E(k)ⁱ for 'i in 0:k-1' to describe which component of the restriction we choose.\n\nTypes G₂ and F₄. The matrices of character values and the orderings and labelings  of  the  irreducible  characters  are  exactly  the  same  as in Carter1985,  p.412/413:  in  type  G₂  the  character φ₁,₃'  takes the value -1 on the reflection associated to the long simple root;  in type F₄, the characters φ₁,₁₂', φ₂,₄', φ₄,₇', φ₈,₉' and φ₉,₆' occur in the induced of the identity from the A₂ corresponding to the  short  simple  roots;  the  pairs  (φ₂,₁₆',  φ₂,₄″)  and (φ₈,₃', φ₈,₉″)  are  related  by  tensoring  by  sign; and finally φ₆,₆″ is the exterior  square of the  reflection representation. Note,  however, that we put  the long root at  the left of the  Dynkin diagrams to be in accordance with the conventions in Lusztig1985, (4.8) and (4.10).\n\nThe classes are labeled by Carter's admissible diagrams Carter1972.  A character  is labeled  by a pair (d,b) where  d denotes the  degree and b  the corresponding b-invariant. If there  are several characters with the same  pair (d,b) we attach a prime to them, as in Carter1985.\n\nTypes  E₆,E₇,E₈. The character  tables are obtained  by specialization of those  of the Hecke algebra. The classes are labeled by Carter's admissible diagrams Carter1972. A character is labeled by the pair (d,b)  where  d  denotes  the  degree  and  b  is  the  corresponding b-invariant.  For  these  types,  this  gives  a  unique  labeling of the characters.\n\nNon-crystallographic  types I₂(m), H₃, H₄. In these cases we do not have  canonical  labelings  for  the  classes.  We  label  them  by reduced expressions.\n\nEach  character for  type H₃  is uniquely  determined by the pair (d,b) where  d is the degree and  b the corresponding b-invariant. For type H₄  there are just  two characters (those  of degree 30)  for which the corresponding  pairs are  the same.  These two  characters are nevertheless distinguished  by  their  fake  degrees:  the  character φ₃₀,₁₀' has fake degree  q¹⁰+q¹²+ higher terms, while φ₃₀,₁₀″ has fake degree q¹⁰+q¹⁴+ higher  terms. The characters in the table for type H₄ are ordered in the same way as in Alvis and Lusztig1982.\n\nFinally,  the characters  of degree 2  for type  I₂(m) are  ordered as follows.  The matrix representations affording the characters of degree 2 are given by: ρ_j  s₁s₂  beginpmatrixE(m)^j00E(m)^-jendpmatrix  s₁beginpmatrix0110endpmatrix where  1 ≤ j ≤  ⌊(m-1)/2⌋. The reflection representation is  ρ₁. The  characters in  the table  are ordered by listing first the characters of degree 1 and then ρ₁,ρ₂,….\n\nPrimitive complex reflection groups G₄ to G₃₄. The  groups G₂₃=H₃, G₂₈=F₄, G₃₀=H₄ are exceptional Coxeter groups and have  been  explained  above.  Similarly  for  the  other groups labels for characters  consist primarily  of the  pair (d,b)  where d  denotes the degree  and b is the corresponding  b-invariant. This is sufficient for G₄,  G₁₂, G₂₂ and G₂₄. For other  groups there are pairs or triples of  characters which  have the  same (d,b)  value. We  disambiguate these according  to  the  conventions  of Malle2000 for G₂₇, G₂₉, G₃₁, G₃₃ and G₃₄:\n\nFor G₂₇:\n\nThe  fake degree  of φ₃,₅'  (resp. φ₃,₂₀',  φ₈,₉″) has smaller degree that  of  φ₃,₅″  (resp.  φ₃,₂₀″,  φ₈,₉'). The characters φ₅,₁₅' and φ₅,₆' occur with multiplicity 1 in the induced from the trivial character of  the parabolic subgroup  of type A₂  generated by the  first and third generator  (it is asserted mistakenly in Malle2000 that φ₅,₆″ does not occur in this induced; it occurs with multiplicity 2).\n\nFor G₂₉:\n\nThe  character  φ₆,₁₀‴  is  the  exterior  square  of φ₄,₁; its complex conjugate  is φ₆,₁₀⁗. The  character φ₁₅,₄″ occurs  in φ₄,₁⊗φ₄,₃; the character  φ₁₅,₁₂″  is  tensored  by  the  sign  character from φ₁₅,₄″. Finally  φ₆,₁₀' occurs in  the induced from  the trivial character of the standard parabolic subgroup of type A₃ generated by the first, second and fourth generators.\n\nFor G₃₁:\n\nThe  characters φ₁₅,₈', φ₁₅,₂₀' and φ₄₅,₈″ occur in φ₄,₁⊗φ₂₀,₇; the character   φ₂₀,₁₃'  is  complex  conjugate  of  φ₂₀,₇;  the  character φ₄₅,₁₂'  is tensored by sign of φ₄₅,₈'. The two terms of maximal degree of  the fakedegree of φ₃₀,₁₀' are  q⁵⁰+q⁴⁶ while for φ₃₀,₁₀″ they are q⁵⁰+2q⁴⁶.\n\nFor G₃₃:\n\nThe  terms of  maximal degree  of the  fakedegree of φ₁₀,₈' are q²⁸+q²⁶ while  for φ₁₀,₈' they are q²⁸+q²⁴. The  terms of maximal degree of the fakedegree   of  φ₄₀,₅'  are  q³¹+q²⁹   while  for  φ₄₀,₅″  they  are q³¹+2q²⁹.  The character  φ₁₀,₁₇' is  tensored by  sign of φ₁₀,₈' and φ₄₀,₁₄' is tensored by sign of φ₄₀,₅'.\n\nFor G₃₄:\n\nThe  character φ₂₀,₃₃' occurs in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₅,₁₄. The character φ₇₀,₉' is rational.  The character  φ₇₀,₉″ occurs  in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₅,₁₄.  The character φ₇₀,₄₅'   is  rational.The   character  φ₇₀,₄₅″   is  tensored  by  the determinant  character of  φ₇₀,₉″. The  character φ₅₆₀,₁₈' is rational. The character φ₅₆₀,₁₈‴ occurs in φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇. The character φ₂₈₀,₁₂' occurs    in   φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇.   The   character   φ₂₈₀,₃₀″   occurs   in φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇.  The  character  φ₅₄₀,₂₁'  occurs  in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₀₅,₂₀. The character  φ₁₀₅,₈' is  complex conjugate  of φ₁₀₅,₄,  and φ₈₄₀,₁₃' is complex  conjugate  of  φ₈₄₀,₁₁.  The  character  φ₈₄₀,₂₃'  is  complex conjugate  of  φ₈₄₀,₁₉.  Finally  φ₁₂₀,₂₁'  occurs  in induced from the trivial character of the standard parabolic subgroup of type A₅ generated by the generators of G₃₄ with the third one omitted.\n\nFor  the groups G₅ and G₇ we  adopt the following conventions. For G₅ they are compatible with those of MalleRouquier2003 and BroueMalleMichel2014.\n\nFor G₅:\n\nWe  let W=complex_reflection_group(5),  so the  generators are  W(1) and W(2).\n\nThe  character φ₁,₄' (resp. φ₁,₁₂', φ₂,₃') takes the value 1 (resp. ζ₃,  -ζ₃)  on  W(1).  The  character  φ₁,₈″ is complex conjugate to φ₁,₁₆,  and the character  φ₁,₈' is complex  conjugate to φ₁,₄' . The character  φ₂,₅″ is complex  conjugate to φ₂,₁;  φ₂,₅' take the value -1 on W(1). The character φ₂,₇' is complex conjugate to φ₂,₅'.\n\nFor G₇:\n\nWe  let W=complex_reflection_group(7),  so the  generators are W(1), W(2) and W(3).\n\nThe  characters  φ₁,₄'  and  φ₁,₁₀'  take  the value 1 on W(2). The character  φ₁,₈″ is complex  conjugate to φ₁,₁₆  and φ₁,₈' is complex conjugate  to φ₁,₄'. The characters φ₁,₁₂'  and φ₁,₁₈' take the value ζ₃  on W(2). The character φ₁,₁₄″ is complex conjugate to φ₁,₂₂ and φ₁,₁₄'  is complex conjugate to φ₁,₁₀'. The character φ₂,₃' takes the value  -ζ₃ on  W(2) and  φ₂,₁₃' takes  the value  -1 on W(2). The characters  φ₂,₁₁″, φ₂,₅″, φ₂,₇‴ and  φ₂,₁ are Galois conjugate, as well  as  the  characters  φ₂,₇',  φ₂,₁₃',  φ₂,₁₁'  and  φ₂,₅'. The character  φ₂,₉' is complex  conjugate to φ₂,₁₅  and φ₂,₉‴ is complex conjugate to φ₂,₃'.\n\nFinally,  for the remaining groups G₆, G₈  to G₁₁, G₁₃ to G₂₁, G₂₅, G₂₆,  G₃₂ and G₃₃ there are only  pairs of characters with same value (d,b).  We give labels uniformly to these characters by applying in order the following rules :\n\nIf the two characters have  different fake degrees, label φ_{d,b}' the  one  whose  fake  degree  is  minimal  for  the  lexicographic  order of  polynomials (starting with the highest term).\nFor the not yet labeled pairs, if only one of the two characters has the  property   that  in  its   Galois  orbit  at   least  one  character  is  distinguished by its (d,b)-invariant, label it φ_{d,b}'.\nFor the not yet labeled pairs,  if the minimum of the (d,b)-value (for  the  lexicographic  order  (d,b))  in  the  Galois  orbits  of the two  character  is different, label φ_{d,b}' the character with the minimal  minimum.\nWe define now a new invariant  for characters: consider all the pairs of  irreducible   characters  χ  and  ψ  uniquely  determined  by  their  (d,b)-invariant such that φ occurs with non-zero multiplicity m in  χ⊗ψ.  We define  t(φ) to  be the  minimal (for  lexicographic order)  possible list (d(χ),b(χ),d(ψ),b(ψ),m).\n\nFor  the not  yet labeled  pairs, if  the t-invariants are different, label φ_{d,b}' the character with the minimal t-invariant.\n\nAfter  applying  the  last  rule  all  the  pairs  will be labelled for the considered  groups. The labelling obtained  is compatible for G₂₅, G₂₆, G₃₂  and G₃₃  with that  of Malle2000  and for G₈ with that described in MalleRouquier2003.\n\nWe  should  emphasize  that  for  all  groups  with  a  few exceptions, the parameters  for characters do  not depend on  any non-canonical choice. The exceptions  are G(de,e,n) with e>1, and G₅, G₇, G₂₇, G₂₈, G₂₉ and  G₃₄, groups  which admit  outer automorphisms  preserving the set of reflections,  so choices  of a  particular value  on a particular generator must be made for characters which are not invariant by these automorphisms.\n\nLabels  for the classes. For the exceptional complex reflection groups, the labels  for the classes represent the  decomposition of a representative of the  class as a product of generators, with the additional conventions that 'z'  represents the generator  of the center  and for well-generated groups 'c'  represents a Coxeter element  (a product of the  generators which is a regular element for the highest reflection degree).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"chars.html#Gapjm.Chars.CharTable","page":"Classes/characters of reflection groups","title":"Gapjm.Chars.CharTable","text":"CharTable is a structure to hold character tables of groups and Hecke  algebras\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"chars.html#Gapjm.Chars.on_chars","page":"Classes/characters of reflection groups","title":"Gapjm.Chars.on_chars","text":"on_chars(G,aut)\n\naut  is an automorphism of  the group G (for  a permutation group, this could  be  given  as  a  permutation  normalizing  G).

An eigenvector r∈ V of s  for the eigenvalue  ζₛ is called  a root of  s and a linear form rᵛ on V of kernel Hₛ is called a coroot of s. If r and rᵛ are normalized  so that  rᵛ(r)=1-ζ, then  s is  the map  on V  defined by s(x)=x-rᵛ(x)r. Such a normalized root and coroot for s are unique up to scaling the root and inversely scaling the coroot.\n\nA  finite  complex  reflection  group  W  is  a finite group generated by complex  reflections.  Since  whenever  W  contains  a  reflection s it contains  its powers, W is always  generated by reflections s such that ζₛ==E(d)  where d is the  order of s; we  can also assume that s is not  a power of another reflection with larger order d. Such a reflection is  called a distinguished reflection of W; it is a canonical generator of  the cyclic  subgroup of  W centralizing  Hₛ. The  generators of the complex   reflection   groups   we   construct   are  always  distinguished reflections; the set of distinguished reflections are in bijection with the reflecting  hyperplanes.  In  a  real  reflection group all reflections are distinguished.\n\nIt  is much  more efficient  to compute  with permutation  groups than with matrix  groups; hence we use for computing with a finite complex reflection group  W a permutation representation on  a W-invariant set of root and coroot vectors for reflections of W; that is, a set R of pairs (r,rᵛ)∈ V×Vᵛ  invariant by W and such that every distinguished reflection in W is determined by some pair in R (see reflectionMatrix). Using a W-invariant  set implies that there may  be several pairs determining the same reflection, which differ by roots of unity. This generalizes the usual construction  for Coxeter groups (the case K=ℝ) where to each reflection of  W  is  associated  two  roots,  one  positive  and  one negative. \n\nA  complex reflection group  is irreducible if  the representation V is irreducible.  For irreducible complex reflection groups, there are at least as many roots for a given reflection as the order of the center of W.\n\nThe  following  methods  are  always  defined for finite complex reflection groups:\n\ngens(W): the (distinguished) reflections which generate W, given as permutations of the roots. reflrep(W) gives them as matrices.\nroots(W): the list of roots of W.\ncoroots(W): the list of coroots, in the same order as the roots.\nrefls(W):  a list of  distinguished reflections of  W, as permutations. This list is of same length as the roots, and its i-th element is the distinguished   reflection  for  the  i-th  root,  so  it  will  have repetitions. unique_refls(W) returns a sublist of 1:length(roots(W)) such that the distinguished reflections around the corresponding  roots reach one time  only each distinguished reflection of W.\n\nThe  lists roots, coroots and refls starts with the \"generating\" ones (those corresponding to gens(W)).\n\nsimpleroots(W):  the generating roots as a matrix.\nsimplecoroots(W):  the generating coroots as a matrix.\nreflections(W) gives a list without repetitions of all reflections of W   (not   only   the   distinguished   ones),  as  objects  of  type Reflection.  These objects  contain more  information on each reflection.\n\nThe  finite  irreducible  complex  reflection  groups  have been completely classified  by Shephard and  Todd, see ShephardTodd1954. They  consist of one infinite family  G(de,e,r) depending on 3 parameters (which  includes the infinite families of  Weyl groups), and 34 exceptional groups  which have been given  by Shephard and Todd  names which range from G₄  to  G₃₇.  These  exceptional  groups  include  the exceptional Weyl groups, e.g., coxgroup(:E,8) is the same as G₃₇.\n\nWe provide functions to build any finite reflection group, either by giving a  list  of  roots  and  coroots  defining  the generating reflections (see PRG), or in terms of the classification (see complex_reflection_group).  In the  context e.g.  of Weyl groups, one  wants to  describe the  particular root  system chosen  in term of the traditional  classification of crystallographic root  systems. This is done via   calls  to  the  function   coxeter_group  (see  the  module Weyl).  There is not yet  a general theory on  how to construct a nice  set of roots for  a non-real reflection group;  the roots chosen here where  obtained  case-by-case;  however,  they  satisfy  several  important properties:\n\nThe generating reflections  satisfy braid relations  which present the braid group associated to W (see diagram).\nThe field  of definition  of W  is the  field K generated by the traces  of the elements of W acting on  V. It is a theorem that W may be realized as a reflection group over K.\nThe Cartan matrix rᵛ(r') where r and r' runs over the roots and\n\ncoroots  for the generating reflections has  entries in the ring ℤₖ of    integers  of  K,  and  the  other  roots  (resp.  coroots)  are linear    combinations with coefficients in ℤₖ  of a linearly independent subset    of them.\n\nIt  turns out that all representations of W are defined over the field of definition K (see. Benard1976 and D.~Bessis' thesis).

We say that F₀∈ GL(V)  is an  automorphism of  R if  it permutes  R and is of finite order  (finite  order  is  automatic  if  R generates V). It follows by chap.  VI,  §1.1,  lemme  1  Bourbaki1968 that the dual F₀*∈  GL(V*)  permutes  the  coroots  R*⊂  V*; thus F₀ normalizes the reflection  group  W  associated  to  R,  that  is  w↦  F₀wF₀⁻¹ is an automorphism  of W. Thus we get a reflection coset WF₀, which we call a Coxeter coset.\n\nThe  motivation for introducing Coxeter  cosets comes from automorphisms of algebraic  reductive groups, giving rise to non-split reductive groups over finite fields. Let 𝐆 be a connected reductive algebraic group 𝐆 over an algebraic  closure 𝔽̄_q of a finite field 𝔽_q, defined over 𝔽_q; this corresponds  to a  Frobenius endomorphism  F so  that the finite group of rational  points 𝐆(𝔽_q) identifies to the  subgroup 𝐆^F of fixed points under F.\n\nLet 𝐓 be a maximal torus of 𝐆, and Φ (resp. Φ*) be the roots (resp. coroots)  of 𝐆 with respect  to 𝐓 in the  character group X(𝐓) (resp. the  group of one-parameter subgroups Y(𝐓)). Then 𝐆 is determined up to isomorphism  by (X(𝐓),Φ,Y(𝐓),Φ*); this corresponds  to give a root system in   the  vector  space  V=ℚ ⊗ X(𝐓)   and  a  rational  reflection  group W=N_𝐆(𝐓)/𝐓 acting on it.\n\nIf  𝐓 is F-stable the Frobenius endomorphism F acts also naturally on X(T)  and defines thus  an endomorphism of  V, which is  of the form q F₀, where F₀∈ GL(V) is of finite order and normalizes W. We get thus a Coxeter  coset WF₀⊂GL(V).  The data  (X(𝐓), Φ,  Y(𝐓), Φ*,  F₀), and the integer   q  completely  determine  up   to  isomorphism  the  associated reductive finite group 𝐆^F. Thus these data is a way of representing in the  essential  information  which  determines  a  finite  reductive group. Indeed, all properties of Chevalley groups can be computed from that datum: symbols  representing characters, conjugacy classes,  and finally the whole character table of 𝐆^F.\n\nIt  turns out that  many interesting objects  attached to this datum depend only on (V,W, F₀): the order of the maximal tori, the fake degrees, the order  of 𝐆^F, symbols representing unipotent characters, Deligne-Lusztig induction  in  terms  of  almost  characters, the Fourier matrix relating characters and almost characters, etc… (see, e.g., Broue-Malle-Michel1993).  It is thus possible to extend their  construction to non-crystallographic groups (or even to more general complex  reflection groups,  see spets);  this is  why we did not include  a root  system in  the definition  of a reflection coset. However, unipotent conjugacy classes for instance depend on the root system.\n\nWe assume now that 𝐓 is contained in an F-stable Borel subgroup of 𝐆. This  defines an order  on the roots,  and there is  a unique element ϕ∈ W F₀,  the  reduced  element  of  the  coset,  which  preserves the set of positive  roots.  It  thus  defines  a  diagram  automorphism, that is an automorphism  of the Coxeter system (W,S).  This element is stored in the component  .phi of the coset record. It may be defined without mentioning the  roots,  as  follows:  (W,F₀(S))  is  another  Coxeter  system,  thus conjugate to S by a unique element of W, thus there is a unique element ϕ∈  WF₀ which stabilizes S (a proof  follows from Theoreme 1, chap. V, §3  Bourbaki1968). We  consider thus  cosets of the form Wϕ where ϕ stabilizes S. The coset W ϕ is completely defined by the permutation  .phi  when  𝐆  is  semi-simple  –-  equivalently when Φ generates  V; in this  case we just  need to specify  phi to define the coset.\n\nThere is a slight generalisation of the above setup, covering in particular the  case of the Ree  and Suzuki groups. We  consider 𝐆^F where F not a Frobenius  endomorphism, but  an isogeny  such that  some power  F^n is a Frobenius endomorphism. Then F still defines an endomorphism of V which normalizes  W; we define a real number q such that F^n is attached to an  𝔽_{qⁿ}-structure. Then we still have F=q F₀ where F₀ is of finite order  but q is no more an integer.  Thus F₀∈ GL(V⊗ ℝ) but F₀∉ GL(V). For  instance, for the  Ree and Suzuki  groups, F₀ is  an automorphism of order  2 of W, which is of type G₂, B₂ or F₄, and q=√2 for B₂ and  F₄ and q=√3  for G₂ This  can be constructed  starting from root systems  for G₂, B₂ or  F₄ where all the  roots have the same length. This kind of root system is not crystallographic. Such non-crystallographic  root systems exist for all finite Coxeter groups such as  the dihedral groups, H₃ and H₄. We will call here Weyl cosets the cosets  corresponding to rational forms  of algebraic groups, which include thus some non-rational roots systems for B₂, G₂ and F₄.\n\nSpets\n\nWe  now extend the above notions  to general complex reflection groups. Let W⊂  GL(V) be a complex reflection group  on the vector space V. Let ϕ be  an element  of GL(V)  which normalizes  W. Then  the coset  Wϕ is called a reflection coset.\n\nA reference for these cosets is Broue-Malle-Michel 1999. When W is a so-called Spetsial group, they are the basic object for the construction  of  a  Spetses,  which  is  an object attached to a complex reflection  group from which one can derive combinatorially some attributes shared with finite reductive groups, like unipotent degrees, etc….\n\nWe  say that  a reflection  coset is  irreducible if  W is irreducible. A general  coset is a direct  product of descents of  scalars, which is the case  where ϕ  is transitive  on the  irreducible components  of W. The irreducible    cosets   have   been   classified   in   Broue-Malle-Michel 1999:  up to multiplication of ϕ by a scalar, there is usually only one or two possible cosets for a given irreducible group.\n\nWe  deal only  with finite  order cosets,  that is,  we assume there is a (minimal) integer δ such that (Wϕ)^δ=W. Then the group generated by W and ϕ is finite, of order δ|W|.\n\nA  subset C  of a  Wϕ is  called a  conjugacy class  if one of the following equivalent conditions is fulfilled:\n\nC is the orbit of an element in Wϕ under the conjugation action of W.\nC is a conjugacy class of ⟨W,ϕ⟩ contained in Wϕ.\nThe set {w∈ W|wϕ∈ C} is  a ϕ-conjugacy  class of W (two elements\n\nv,w∈  W are called ϕ-conjugate, if and only if there exists x∈ W with v=xwϕ(x⁻¹)).\n\nAn irreducible character of ⟨W,ϕ⟩ has some non-zero values on Wϕ if and only if its restriction to W is irreducible. Further, two characters χ₁ and  χ₂  which  have  same  irreducible  restriction  to  W differ by a character  of  the  cyclic  group  ⟨ϕ⟩  (which identifies to the quotient ⟨W,ϕ⟩/W). A set containing one extension to ⟨W,ϕ⟩ of each ϕ-invariant character  of W is called a set  of irreducible characters of Wϕ. Two such  characters  are  orthogonal  for  the  scalar  product  on  the class functions on Wϕ given by χψ=W¹_w Wχ(wϕ)overlineψ(wϕ) For rational groups (Weyl groups), Lusztig has defined a choice of a set of irreducible  characters for  Wϕ (called  the preferred extensions), but for  more  general  reflection  cosets  we  have made some rather arbitrary choices,  which  however  have  the  property  that their values lie in the smallest possible field.\n\nThe  character  table  of  Wϕ  is  the  table  of  values  of  a set of irreducible characters on the conjugacy classes.\n\nA subcoset Lwϕ of Wϕ is given by a reflection subgroup L of W and an element w of W such that wϕ normalizes L.\n\nWe  then have a natural notion of  restriction of class functions on Wϕ to  class  functions  on  Lwϕ  as  well  as  of  induction in the other direction.  These  maps  are  adjoint  with  respect  to the scalar product defined above (see Broue-Malle-Michel 1999).\n\nIn  this package the most general construction  of a reflection coset is by starting  from a reflection datum, and giving in addition the matrix F of the  map ϕ:V→ V  (see the command  spets). However, at present, general cosets are only implemented for groups represented as permutation groups on a  set of roots, and  it is required that  the automorphism given preserves this  set up to  a scalar (it  is allowed that  these scalars depend on the pair  of an  irreducible component  and its  image). It  is also allowed to specify  ϕ by the permutation it induces on the roots; in this case it is assumed  that ϕ acts  trivially on the  orthogonal of the  roots, but the roots  could be those of a parent group, generating a larger space. Thus in any  case we have  a permutation representation  of ⟨W,ϕ⟩ and we consider the coset to be a set of permutations.\n\nReflection  cosets  are  implemented  in  by  a  struct which points to a reflection  group  record  and  has  additional  fields holding F and the corresponding  permutation phi. In the general case, on each component of W  which is  a descent  of scalars,  F will  permute the components and differ  by a scalar on each  component from an automorphism which preserves the  roots. In this case, we have  a permutation phi and a scalar which is stored for that component.\n\nThe  most common situation where cosets  with non-trivial phi arise is as sub-cosets  of reflection groups. Here is an \"exotic\" example, see the next chapter for more classical examples involving Coxeter groups.\n\njulia> W=complex_reflection_group(14)\nG₁₄\n\njulia> R=reflection_subgroup(W,[2,4])\nG₁₄₍₂₄₎=G₅\n\njulia> RF=spets(R,W(1)) # should be ²G₅(√6)\nG₁₄₍₂₄₎=²G₅\n\njulia> diagram(RF)\nϕ acts as (1,2) on the component below\n③ ══③ G₅\n1   2\n\njulia> degrees(RF)\n2-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Cyc{Int64}}}:\n (6, 1)\n (12, -1)\n\nThe  last line shows for each  reflection degree the corresponding factor of  the coset, which is  the scalar by which  ϕ acts on the corresponding fundamental reflection invariant.

The function  repr gives a form which could be input back in Julia. With the same data as above we have:\n\njulia> print(RF)\nspets(reflection_subgroup(complex_reflection_group(14),[2, 4]),perm\"(1,3)(2,4)(5,9)(6,10)(7,11)(8,12)(13,21)(14,22)(15,23)(16,24)(17,25)(18,26)(19,27)(20,28)(29,41)(30,42)(31,43)(32,44)(33,45)(34,46)(35,47)(36,48)(37,49)(38,50)(39,51)(40,52)(53,71)(54,72)(55,73)(56,74)(57,75)(58,76)(59,77)(60,78)(62,79)(64,80)(65,81)(66,82)(67,69)(68,70)(83,100)(84,101)(85,102)(87,103)(89,99)(90,97)(91,98)(92,96)(93,104)(94,95)(105,113)(106,114)(109,111)(110,112)(115,118)(116,117)(119,120)\")\n\nConjugacy  classes and irreducible characters of Coxeter cosets are defined as  for  general  reflection  cosets.  For  irreducible  characters of Weyl cosets,  we choose (following Lusztig) for each ϕ-stable character of W a  particular extension to a character of  W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩, which we will call the preferred extension. The character table of the coset Wϕ is the table of  the restrictions to  Wϕ of the  preferred extensions. The question of finding the conjugacy classes and character table of a Coxeter coset can be reduced to the case of irreducible root systems R.\n\nThe automorphism ϕ permutes the irreducible components of W, and Wϕ  is a direct  product of cosets  where ϕ permutes cyclically the irreducible components of W. The preferred extension is defined to be the  direct  product  of  the  preferred  extension  in  each  of these situations.\nAssume now that Wϕ is a descent of scalars, that is the decomposition in irreducible components W=W₁× ⋯ × Wₖ is cyclically permuted by ϕ. Then there are natural bijections from the ϕ-conjugacy classes of W to  the ϕᵏ-conjugacy classes  of W₁ as  well as from the ϕ-stable characters  of W to the ϕᵏ-stable  characters of W₁, which reduce the  definition of preferred  extensions on Wϕ  to the definition for W₁ϕᵏ.\nAssume now  that W  is the  Coxeter group  of an  irreducible root system.   ϕ  permutes  the  simple   roots,  hence  induces  a  graph automorphism  on  the  corresponding  Dynkin  diagram.  If  ϕ=1  then conjugacy  classes and  characters coincide  with those  of the Coxeter group W.\n\nThe  nontrivial cases for crystallographic roots  systems are (the order of ϕ  is written as left exponent to  the type): ²Aₙ, ²Dₙ, ³D₄, ²E₆. For  non-crystallographic root  systems where  all the  roots have the same length the additional cases ²B₂, ²G₂, ²F₄ and ²I₂(k) arise.\n\nIn  case  ³D₄  the  group  W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩  can be embedded into the Coxeter  group of type F₄, which induces a labeling for the conjugacy classes of the coset. The preferred extension is chosen as the (single) extension with rational values.\nIn case  ²Dₙ the  group W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩  is isomorphic  to a Coxeter group of type Bₙ. This induces a canonical labeling for the conjugacy classes  of the coset and allows to define the preferred extension in a combinatorial  way  using  the  labels  (pairs  of  partitions) for the characters of the Coxeter group of type Bₙ.\nIn the remaining crystallographic cases ϕ identifies to -w₀ where w₀  is the longest element of W.  So, there is a canonical labeling of  the conjugacy classes and characters of  the coset by those of W. The  preferred extensions  are defined  by describing  the signs of the character values on -w₀.\n\nThe  most general  construction of  a Coxeter  coset is  by starting from a Coxeter   datum   specified   by   the   matrices   of   simpleRoots  and simplecoroots,  and  giving  in  addition  the  matrix F0Mat of the map F₀:V→ V (see the commands  CoxeterCoset and CoxeterSubCoset). As for Coxeter  groups,  the  elements  of  Wϕ  are  uniquely  determined by the permutation  they  induce  on  the  set  of  roots  R.  We consider these permutations as elements of the Coxeter coset.\n\nCoxeter  cosets are implemented by a struct which points to a Coxeter datum record  and  has  additional  fields  holding F0Mat and the corresponding element  phi. Functions on the coset (for example, classinfo) are about properties  of  the  group  coset  W  ϕ  ;  however, most definitions for elements of untwisted Coxeter groups apply without change to elements in W ϕ:  e.g., if we define the length of  an element wϕ∈ Wϕ as the number of positive  roots it sends to negative ones, it  is the same as the length of w,  i.e., ϕ is of length 0, since ϕ has been chosen to preserve the set of positive roots. Similarly, the Coxeter word describing wϕ is the same as the one for w, etc…\n\nWe associate to a Coxeter coset Wϕ a twisted Dynkin diagram, consisting of  the Dynkin diagram of W and  the graph automorphism induced by ϕ on this  diagram (this specifies the  group W⋊ ⟨F⟩, mentioned above, up to  isomorphism). See the  functions ReflectionType, ReflectionName and diagram for Coxeter cosets.\n\nBelow  is an example showing first how to not define, then how to define, the Weyl coset for a Suzuki group:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:B,2)\nB₂\n\njulia> spets(W,Perm(1,2))\nERROR: matrix F must preserve the roots\nStacktrace:\n [1] error(::String) at ./error.jl:33\n [2] spets(::Gapjm.Weyl.FCG{Int16,Int64,PRG{Int64,Int16}}, ::Matrix{Int64}) at /home/jmichel/julia/Gapjm/src/Cosets.jl:241 (repeats 2 times)\n [3] top-level scope at REPL[19]:1\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:Bsym,2)\nBsym₂\n\njulia> WF=spets(W,Perm(1,2))\n²Bsym₂\n\njulia> CharTable(WF)\nCharTable(²Bsym₂)\n   │    1 121\n───┼──────────\n2. │1   1   1\n.11│1  -1  -1\n1.1│. -√2  √2\n\nA subcoset Hwϕ of Wϕ is given by a reflection subgroup H of W and an  element w of W  such that wϕ induces  an automorphism of the root system of H.

A left-divisor  of x is  a d such  that there exists y with  x=dy (and then  we say that  x is a  right multiple of d, and write  d≼ x). We say that a monoid M is left cancellable if an equality dx=dy   implies  x=y.  We  define  symmetrically  right-divisors,  left multiples and right cancellability. We say that x is an atom if 1 and x  are its only  divisors. A left  gcd of x  and y is a common left divisor  d of x  and y such  that any other  common left-divisor is a left-divisor  of d.

A Garside monoid embeds into  its group of fractions, which is  called a Garside group (a Garside group  may have  several distinct  Garside structures,  as we  will see for Braid groups of finite Coxeter groups).\n\nWe  also implement locally Garside monoids,  which are monoids where lcms do  not always exist, but  exist if any common  multiple exists; the set of simples is then not defined by a Garside element, but by the condition that they  contain the atoms and are closed  under lcms and taking divisors (see BDM01);  since this is not  ensured by the existence of Δ,  one  has  to  add  the  condition  that  each element is divisible by finitely many simples (but the number of simples can be infinite). The main example  is the Artin monoid of an  infinite Coxeter group. It is not known whether  these monoids embed  in their group  of fractions (though this has been proved for braid monoids of Coxeter groups by Paris Paris01)  and thus  computing in  the monoid does not help  for computing in the group (only  the monoid is implemented for these cases).\n\nWhat allows computing with Garside and locally Garside monoids, and Garside groups,  is the fact  that they admit  normal forms –-  these normal forms where   exhibited  for   braid  monoids   of  Coxeter   groups  by  Deligne Del72,  who extended previous  work of Brieskorn, Saito BS72 and Garside Gar69:\n\nLet M be a locally Garside monoid. Then for b∈ M there is a unique  maximal simple left-divisor α(b) of b; any other simple dividing b divides α(b).\nLet M be a Garside monoid with Garside element Δ and group of fractions G. Then for any x∈  G, for large enough i we have Δⁱx∈ M.\n\nA  consequence of 1. is that any element has a canonical decomposition as a product of simples, called its left-greedy normal form. If we define ω(x) by  x=α(x)ω(x), then the normal form of x is α(x)α(ω(x))α(ω^2(x))… We use  the normal form to represent elements  of M, and when M is Garside we  use  2.  to  represent  elements  of  G:  given x∈ G we compute the smallest  power i such that Δⁱ x∈ M, and we represent x by the couple (i,Δ⁻ⁱx).  We are thus reduced to the case where x∈ M, not divisible by Δ,  where we represent  x by the  sequence of simples which constitutes its normal form.\n\nWe  now describe Artin-Tits braid monoids. Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system, that is W has presentation\n\n⟨s∈ S∣s²=1, sts⋯ =tst⋯   (mₛₜ factors on each side) for s,t∈ S⟩\n\nfor some Coxeter matrix mₛₜ. The braid group B associated to (W,S) is the group defined by the presentation\n\n⟨𝐬∈ 𝐒∣ 𝐬𝐭𝐬⋯ =𝐭𝐬𝐭⋯  (mₛₜ factors on each side) for 𝐬,𝐭∈ 𝐒⟩\n\nThe positive braid monoid B⁺ associated to W is the monoid defined by the  presentation above –- it identifies to the submonoid of B generated by  𝐒 by  the result  of Paris  mentioned above.  This monoid  is locally Garside,  with set of simples  in bijection with elements  of W and atoms the elements of 𝐒; we will denote by 𝐖 the set of simples, and by 𝐰 ↦ w  the bijection between simples and elements  of W. The group W has a length  defined  in  terms  of  reduced expressions. Similarly, having only homogeneous relations, B⁺ has a natural length function. Then 𝐖 can be characterized  as the subset of the elements  of B⁺ of the same length as their image in W.\n\nIf  W is finite, then B⁺ is Garside with Garside element the element of 𝐖 whose image is the longest element  of W. A finite Coxeter group is also  a reflection group in  a real vector space,  thus in its complexified V,  and B has also a topological definition as the fundamental group of the  space Vʳᵉᵍ/W, where Vʳᵉᵍ  is the set of  elements of V which are fixed  by no  non-identity element  of S;  however, we  will not use this here.\n\nWe  implement in general only  monoids which have a  finite number of atoms (there  is  a  special  implementation  for  the  Dual monoid of the affine Coxeter group W(Ãₙ)).\n\nGiven a Coxeter group W,\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,4)\nA₄\n\njulia> B=BraidMonoid(W)\nBraidMonoid(A₄)\n\nconstructs  the  associated  braid  monoid,  and  then  as  a  function B constructs  elements of the braid monoid (or group when W is finite) from a list of generators:\n\njulia> w=B(1,2,3,4) # represents 𝐬₁𝐬₂𝐬₃𝐬₄\n1234\n\njulia> w^3  # the terms of the normal form are separated by a .\n121321432.343\n\njulia> word(α(w^3))\n9-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 3\n 2\n 1\n 4\n 3\n 2\n\njulia> w^4\nΔ.232432\n\njulia> inv(w)\n(1234)⁻¹\n\nHow  an  element  of  a  Garside  group  is  printed  is  controlled by the IOcontext  attribute  ':greedy'.  By  default,  elements  are  printed as fractions a⁻¹b where a and b have no left common divisor. Each of a and  b is printed  using its left-greedy  normal form, that  is a maximal power of the Garside element followed by the rest. One can print the entire element   in  the  left-greedy  normal  from  by  setting  the  IOContext :greedy=>true; with the same w as above we have:\n\njulia> repr(w^-1,context=IOContext(stdout,:greedy=>true,:limit=>true))\n\"Δ⁻¹.232432\"\n\nBy default,  repr gives   w  back   in  a   form  which   after  assigning B=BraidMonoid(W) can be input back into Julia:\n\njulia> repr(w)\n\"B(1,2,3,4)\"\n\njulia> repr(w^3)\n\"B(1,2,1,3,2,1,4,3,2,3,4,3)\"\n\njulia> repr(w^-1)\n\"B(-4,-3,-2,-1)\"\n\nIn  general elements of a  Garside monoid are displayed  as a list of their constituting atoms.\n\nWe  now describe the dual braid monoid.  For that, we first define interval monoids.  Given a group W and a set S of generators of W as a monoid, we  define the S-length l_S(w) as the minimum number of elements of S needed  to write w. We  then define left-divisors  of x as the d such that  there exists y with x=dy  and l_S(d)+l_S(y)=l_S(x). We say that w∈ W is balanced if its set of left and right-divisors coincide; in which case  we  denote  this  set  by  [1,w],  an  \"interval\"  for the poset of S-divisibility.  We say that w  is Garside for the  S-length if it is balanced  and [1,w] is a  lattice (where upper and  lower bounds are lcms and gcds), which generates W. Then we have the theorem:\n\nSuppose  w  is  Garside  for  the  S-length.  Then  the monoid M with generators  [1,w] and relations  xy=z whenever xy=z  holds in W and l_S(x)+l_S(y)=l_S(z), is a Garside monoid, with simples [1,w] and atoms S. It is called the interval monoid defined by the interval [1,w].\n\nThe  Artin-Tits braid monoid  is an interval  monoid by taking  for S the Coxeter  generators, in which case l_S  is the Coxeter length, and taking for w the longest element of W. The dual monoid, constructed by Birman, Ko  and  Lee  for  type  A  and  by Bessis for all well-generated complex reflection  groups, is obtained in  a similar way, by  taking this time for w  a Coxeter element, for l_S the reflection length 'reflength' and for S_S  the  reflections  which  divide  w  for the reflection length (for Coxeter  groups all reflections  divide w but  for well-generated complex reflection  groups not  all reflections  divide); for  the dual  monoid the simples  are of cardinality  the generalized Catalan  numbers catalan. An interval  monoid has naturally an inverse  morphism from M to W, called 'image'  which is the  quotient map from  the interval monoid  to W which sends back simple braids to [1,w].\n\nA last pertinent notion is reversible monoids. Since we store left normal forms,  it is easy to compute left lcms and gcds, but hard to compute right lcms  and gcds. But this becomes easy to  do if the monoid has an operation 'reverse',  which has the property that 'a' is a left-divisor of 'b' if and only  if 'reverse(a)'  is a  right-divisor  of 'reverse(b)'. This holds for Artin-Tits  and dual braid monoids of groups generated by true reflections; Artin-Tits monoids have a reverse operation which consists of reversing a word,  written as  a list  of atoms.  The dual  monoid also has a reverse operation  defined in the  same way, but  this operation changes monoid: it goes  from the dual monoid  for the Coxeter element  w to the dual monoid for  the Coxeter element  w⁻¹. The operations  'rightlcm' and 'rightgcd', and  some other algorithms, have faster implementations if the monoid has a reverse operation.\n\nThis  module implements also  functions to solve  the conjugacy problem and compute  centralizers  in  Garside  groups,  following  the work of Franco, Gebhardt and Gonzalez-Meneses.\n\nTwo  elements w and w' of a monoid  M are conjugate in M if there exists  x∈ M such that wx=xw'; if  M satisfies the Öre conditions, it has  a  group  of  fractions  where  this  becomes  x⁻¹wx=w',  the  usual definition  of conjugacy. A special case  which is even closer to conjugacy in  the group is if there exists y∈  M such that w=xy and w'=yx. This relation  is not transitive in general,  but we call cyclic conjugacy the transitive closure of this relation, a restricted form of conjugacy.\n\nThe  next  observation  is  that  if  w,w'  are conjugate in the group of fractions  of the Garside monoid M then  they are conjugate in M, since if  wx=xw' then  there is  a power  Δⁱ which  is central and such that xΔⁱ∈ M. Then wxΔⁱ=xΔⁱ w' is a conjugation in M.\n\nThe  crucial observation for solving the  conjugacy problem is to introduce inf(w):=sup{i  such that  Δⁱ divides  w} and  sup(w):=inf{i such  that w divides  Δⁱ}, and to notice that the number of conjugates of w with same inf and sup as w is finite (since our monoids have a finite number of atoms).  Further,  a  theorem  of  Birman  shows that the maximum inf and minimum  sup in  a conjugacy  class can  be achieved  simultaneously; the elements  achieving this are called the super summit set of w. Thus a way to  determine if two elements are conjugate  is to find a representative of both  of them in  their super summit  set, and then  solve conjugacy within that  set. This can also be used  to compute the centralizer of an element: if  we consider  the super  summit set  as the  objects of a category whose morphisms are the conjugations by simple elements, the centralizer is given by the endomorphisms of the given object.\n\nWe illustrate this on an example:\n\njulia> b=B(2,1,4,1,4)\n214.14\n\njulia> c=B(1,4,1,4,3)\n14.143\n\njulia> d=conjugating_elt(b,c)\n(1)⁻¹21321432\n\njulia> b^d\n14.143\n\njulia> centralizer_gens(b)\n3-element Vector{GarsideElt{Perm{Int16}, BraidMonoid{Perm{Int16}, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}}}:\n 321432.213243\n 21.1\n 4\n\njulia> C=conjcat(b;ss=:ss)\ncategory with 10 objects and 32 generating maps\n\njulia> C.obj\n10-element Vector{GarsideElt{Perm{Int16}, BraidMonoid{Perm{Int16}, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}}}:\n 1214.4\n 214.14\n 124.24\n 1343.1\n 14.124\n 143.13\n 24.214\n 134.14\n 13.134\n 14.143\n\nThere   is  a   faster  solution   to  the   conjugacy  problem   given  in gebgon10:  for each b∈ M, they define a particular simple  left-divisor of b, its preferred prefix such that the operation sliding  which  cyclically  conjugates  b  by  its preferred prefix, is eventually periodic, and the period is contained in the super summit set of x.  We say that x is in its sliding circuit if some iterated sliding of x is equal to x. The set of sliding circuits in a given conjugacy class is  smaller than the super  summit set, thus allows  to solve the conjugacy problem faster.

It is true (but a non-trivial theorem) that in a Coxeter group the order  of st is exactly  m(s,t), thus a Coxeter  group is the same as a Coxeter  system, that is a pair (W,S) of a group W and a set S⊂W of involutions,  such  that  the  group  is  presented  by  generators S and relations describing the order of the product of two elements of S.\n\nA   Coxeter   group   has   a   natural   representation,  its  reflection representation, on a real vector space V of dimension length(S) (which is  the  Coxeter  rank  of  W),  where  each  element  of  S  acts as a reflection; the faithfulness of this representation in the main argument to prove  that the order  of st is  exactly m(s,t). This representation is defined as follows on a space V with basis {eₛ} for s∈ S. The cartan matrix  associated to the  Coxeter matrix m(s,t)  is the matrix C with entries  C(s,t)=-2cos(π/m(s,t)); we  set C(s,t)=-2  if m(s,t)=∞. Then the action of s∈ S on V is given by s(eₜ)=eₜ-C(s,t)eₛ.\n\nThus, Coxeter groups are  real reflection groups.  The converse need not be true  if the set of reflecting  hyperplanes has bad topological properties, but  it turns out  that finite Coxeter  groups are the  same as finite real reflection  groups. The possible Coxeter matrices for finite Coxeter groups have  been  completely  classified,  see  Weyl; the corresponding finite groups play a deep role in several areas of mathematics.\n\nCoxeter  groups  have  a  nice  solution  to the word problem. The length l(w)  of an element  w∈ W is  the minimum number  of elements of S of which it is a product (since the elements of S are involutions, we do not need inverses). An expression of w of minimum length is called a reduced word  for w. The main property of  reduced words is the exchange lemma which  states that if s₁…sₖ is a reduced word for w (thus k=l(w)) and s∈  S is such that l(sw)≤l(w) then one  of the sᵢ in the word for w can be deleted to obtain a reduced word for sw. Thus given s∈ S and w∈ W,  either l(sw)=l(w)+1 or l(sw)=l(w)-1 and  in the latter case we say that s belongs to the left descent set of w. Computing a reduced word for  an  element,  and  other  word  problems,  are  easy if we know how to multiply elements and know left descent sets. In each of the Coxeter groups that we implement, the left descent set is easy to compute (see for example coxeter_symmetric_group below), so this suggests how to deal with Coxeter groups generically:\n\nThe  type  CoxeterGroup  is  an  abstract  type;  an  actual struct which implements it must define a function\n\nisleftdescent(W,w,i) which tells whether the i-th element of S is in    the left descent set of w.\n\nthe other functions needed in an instance of a Coxeter group are\n\ngens(W) which returns the set S (the list of Coxeter generators)\nnref(W) which  returns the  number of  reflections of  W, if  W is  finite or nothing if W is infinite.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  a  Coxeter  group  can  be any kind of group implementing the above functions.\n\nBecause  of the  easy solution  of the  word problem  in Coxeter  groups, a convenient  way  to  represent  their  elements  is as words in the Coxeter generators,  that  is  lists  of  integers  in 1:length(S). The functions 'word'  and 'W(...)' do the conversion between Coxeter words and elements of the group.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> W=coxsym(4)\n𝔖 ₄\n\njulia> p=W(1,3,2,1,3)\n(1,4)\n\njulia> word(W,p)\n5-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 2\n 1\n\nWe  notice that the word we started with and the one that we ended up with, are  not the same, even though they  represent the same element of W. The reason  is that there are several reduced  words for an element of W. The function 'word' calculates a lexicographically smallest word for w. Below are some other possible computations using the same Coxeter group:\n\njulia> word(W,longest(W))  # the (unique) longest element in W\n6-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 3\n 2\n 1\n\njulia> w0=longest(W)\n(1,4)(2,3)\n\njulia> length(W,w0)\n6\njulia> map(w->word(W,w),refls(W,1:nref(W)))\n6-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:\n [1]\n [2]\n [3]\n [1, 2, 1]\n [2, 3, 2]\n [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\njulia> [length(elements(W,i)) for i in 0:nref(W)]\n7-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 3\n 5\n 6\n 5\n 3\n 1\n\nThe  last list tells us that there is 1 element of length 0, there are 6 of length 3, …\n\nFor  most basic functions the convention is that the input is an element of the  group, rather than a  Coxeter word. The reason  for this is that for a Coxeter  group which is a permutation  group, using the low level functions for   permutations  is   usually  much   faster  than   manipulating  lists representing reduced expressions.\n\nThe only Coxeter group constructors implemented in this module are coxsym and  coxgroup; the last constructor takes  a Cartan matrix and builds the corresponding  Coxeter group as  a matrix group.  The module Weyl defines  other methods for coxgroup building  a finite Coxeter group as a permutation group, given its type.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"coxgroups.html#Gapjm.CoxGroups.isleftdescent-Tuple{CoxSym, Any, Int64}","page":"Coxeter groups","title":"Gapjm.CoxGroups.isleftdescent","text":"isleftdescent(W::CoxeterGroup,w,i::Integer)\n\nreturns  true iff the  i-th generating reflection  of the Coxeter group W  is in  the left  descent set  of the  element w  of W, that is iff length(W,W(i)*w)<length(W,w).\n\njulia> W=coxsym(3)\n𝔖 ₃\n\njulia> isleftdescent(W,Perm(1,2),1)\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"coxgroups.html#Gapjm.CoxGroups.isrightdescent","page":"Coxeter groups","title":"Gapjm.CoxGroups.isrightdescent","text":"isrightdescent(W::CoxeterGroup,w,i::Integer)\n\nreturns  true iff the  i-th generating reflection  of the Coxeter group W  is in the  right descent set  of the element  w of W,  that is iff length(W,w*W(i))<length(W,w).\n\njulia> W=coxsym(3)\n𝔖 ₃\n\njulia> isrightdescent(W,Perm(1,2),1)\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"coxgroups.html#Gapjm.CoxGroups.firstleftdescent","page":"Coxeter groups","title":"Gapjm.CoxGroups.firstleftdescent","text":"firstleftdescent(W,w)\n\nreturns the index in gens(W) of the first element of the left descent set of  w –- that is, the first  i such that if s=W(i) then l(sw)<l(w).

We will  thus denote R_w for R_𝐓^𝐆 (1); this character depends only on the F-class of w.\n\nThe  unipotent characters of 𝐆 ^F are the irreducible constituents of the  R_w. In a similar way that the Jordan decomposition shows that the unipotent classes are a building block for describing the conjugacy classes of  a  reductive  group,  Lusztig  has  defined  a  Jordan decomposition of characters  where  the  unipotent  characters  are  the building block. The unipotent  characters are parameterized by  combinatorial data that Lusztig has  defined just  from the  coset Wφ,  where φ  is the  finite order automorphism  of X(𝐓₀)  such that  F=qφ. Thus,  from our viewpoint, unipotent  characters  are  objects  combinatorially  attached to a Coxeter coset.\n\nA  subset  of  the  unipotent  characters, the principal series unipotent characters,  can  be  described  in  a  more  elementary  way. They are the constituents  of  R₁,  or  equivalently  the  characters of the virtual module  H^*_c(X_𝐁 ₀), where X_𝐁 ₀  is the discrete variety (𝐆 𝐁₀)^F;  this virtual module reduces to the actual module ℚ _ℓ(𝐆 𝐁₀) ^F.  Thus  the  Deligne-Lusztig  induction  R_𝐓₀^𝐆  (1) reduces to Harish-Chandra  induction, defined  as follows:  let 𝐏  =𝐔   𝐋  be an F-stable  Levi decomposition  of an  F-stable parabolic subgroup of 𝐆. Then the Harish-Chandra induced  R_𝐋^𝐆 of a character χ of  𝐋^F is  the character  Ind_𝐏^F^𝐆 ^Fχ,  where χ is the lift  to 𝐏^F of χ via the quotient 𝐏^F𝐔 ^F=𝐋^F; Harish-Chandra induction  is a  particular case  of Lusztig  induction, which is defined when 𝐏 is not F-stable using the variety X_𝐔 = g𝐔 𝐆 𝐔  g𝐔  F(g𝐔  ), and gives for an  𝐋^F-module a virtual 𝐆 ^F-module. Like  ordinary induction, these  functors have adjoint  functors going from representations   of   𝐆   ^F   to   representations   (resp.   virtual representations)   of  𝐋^F  called  Harish-Chandra  restriction  (resp. Lusztig restriction).\n\nThe  commuting algebra of 𝐆^F-endomorphisms of R₁=R_𝐓₀^𝐆(1) is an Iwahori-Hecke  algebra for W^φ, with parameters some powers of q; the parameters  are  all  equal  to  q  when W^φ=W. Thus principal series unipotent characters are parametrized by characters of W^φ.\n\nTo   understand  the  decomposition  of  more  general  R_w,  and  thus parameterize unipotent characters, is is useful to introduce another set of class  functions which are  parameterized by irreducible  characters of the coset  Wφ.  If  χ  is  such  a  character, we define the associated almost  character by:  Rᵪ=W¹_w Wχ(wφ)  R_w. The  name reflects that these class function are close to irreducible characters. They satisfy Rᵪ  R_ψ_𝐆^F=δ_χψ;  for  the  linear  and unitary group they are actually  unipotent characters (up to sign in the latter case). They are in general the sum (with rational coefficients) of a small number of unipotent characters in the same Lusztig family, see Families. The degree of  Rᵪ  is  a  polynomial  in  q  equal  to  the fake degree of the character χ of Wφ (see fakedegree).\n\nWe   now  describe  the  parameterization   of  unipotent  characters  when W^φ=W,  thus when the coset Wφ identifies with W (the situation is  similar  but  a  bit  more  difficult  to  describe  in  general).  The (rectangular) matrix of scalar products ρ Rᵪ_𝐆 ^F, when characters of  W  and  unipotent  characters  are  arranged in the right order, is block-diagonal   with  rather  small  blocks   which  are  called  Lusztig families.\n\nFor the characters of W  a family 𝓕 corresponds  to a block of the Hecke  algebra  over  a  ring  called  the  Rouquier ring. To 𝓕 Lusztig associates  a small group Γ (not  bigger than (ℤ2)ⁿ, or 𝔖ᵢ for i5) such that the unipotent characters in the family are parameterized by the pairs (xθ) taken up to Γ-conjugacy, where xΓ and θ is  an irreducible character of C_Γ(x).  Further, the elements of 𝓕 themselves are parameterized by a subset of such pairs, and Lusztig defines a  pairing  between  such  pairs  which  computes  the scalar product ρ Rᵪ_𝐆^F,  called  the  Lusztig  Fourier  matrix. For more details see drinfeld_double.\n\nA  second parameterization  of unipotent  character is  via Harish-Chandra series.  A character is called cuspidal if all its proper Harish-Chandra restrictions  vanish. There are few  cuspidal unipotent characters (none in GLₙ  for  n1,  and  at  most  one  in other classical groups). The 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra of an Harish-Chandra induced R_𝐋^F^𝐆^Fλ, where λ is a cuspidal unipotent character turns out to be a Hecke algebra associated to the group W_𝐆^F(𝐋^F)=N_𝐆^F(𝐋)𝐋, which turns out to be a Coxeter group. Thus another  parameterization  is  by  triples  (𝐋λφ),  where  λ is a cuspidal  unipotent  character  of  𝐋^F  and  φ  is  an irreducible character  of the  relative group  W_𝐆^F(𝐋^F). Such  characters are said to belong to the Harish-Chandra series determined by (𝐋λ).\n\nA  final  piece  of  information  attached  to  unipotent characters is the eigenvalues of Frobenius. Let Fᵟ be the smallest power of the isogeny F  which  is  a  split  Frobenius  (that  is, Fᵟ is a Frobenius and φᵟ=1). Then Fᵟ acts naturally on Deligne-Lusztig varieties and thus on  the  corresponding  virtual  modules,  and  commutes  to  the action of 𝐆^F;  thus for  a given  unipotent character  ρ, a submodule of the virtual  module which  affords ρ  affords a  single eigenvalue μ of Fᵟ. Results of Lusztig and Digne-Michel show that this eigenvalue is of the  form qᵃᵟλᵨ  where 2aℤ  and λᵨ  is a  root of  unity which depends  only on ρ and not the considered module. This λᵨ is called the  eigenvalue of Frobenius attached to ρ. Unipotent characters in the Harish-Chandra  series  of  a  pair  (𝐋λ)  have the same eigenvalue of Frobenius as λ.\n\nThis  package  contains  tables  of  all  this information, and can compute Harish-Chandra  and Lusztig  induction of  unipotent characters  and almost characters. We illustrate this on some examples:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)\nG₂\n\njulia> uc=UnipotentCharacters(W)\nUnipotentCharacters(G₂)\n      γ│n₀    Deg(γ)  Feg              Symbol Fr(γ)    label\n───────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nφ₁‚₀   │ 1         1    1       (0,0,0,0,0,2)     1\nφ₁‚₆   │ 2        q⁶   q⁶ (01,01,01,01,01,12)     1\nφ′₁‚₃  │ 3   qΦ₃Φ₆/3   q³            (0,0,1+)     1    (1,ρ)\nφ″₁‚₃  │ 4   qΦ₃Φ₆/3   q³            (0,0,1-)     1   (g₃,1)\nφ₂‚₁   │ 5  qΦ₂²Φ₃/6  qΦ₈       (0,0,0,0,1,1)     1    (1,1)\nφ₂‚₂   │ 6  qΦ₂²Φ₆/2 q²Φ₄       (0,0,0,1,0,1)     1   (g₂,1)\nG₂[-1] │ 7  qΦ₁²Φ₃/2    0       (01,0,01,,0,)    -1   (g₂,ε)\nG₂[1]  │ 8  qΦ₁²Φ₆/6    0       (01,01,0,,,0)     1    (1,ε)\nG₂[ζ₃] │ 9 qΦ₁²Φ₂²/3    0       (01,0,0,01,,)    ζ₃  (g₃,ζ₃)\nG₂[ζ₃²]│10 qΦ₁²Φ₂²/3    0       (01,01,,0,0,)   ζ₃² (g₃,ζ₃²)\n\nThe  first column gives  the name of  the unipotent character, derived from its  Harish-Chandra  classification;  the  first  6  characters  are in the principal  series  so  are  named  by  characters  of  W.  The last 4 are cuspidal,  and named by the corresponding eigenvalue of Frobenius, which is displayed  in the fourth  column. For classical  groups, the Harish-Chandra data can be synthesized combinatorially to give a symbol.\n\nThe  first two characters are  each in a Lusztig  family by themselves. The last  eight are in a family associated to the group Γ=𝔖₃: the last column shows  the parameters  (x,θ).

We do not explain the details of this construction, but explain how its final result building Lusztig's Fourier matrix, and a variant of it that we use in Spetses, from Γ.\n\nThe  elements of the family are in bijection  with the set 𝓜 (Γ) of pairs (x,φ)  taken up to  Γ-conjugacy, where x∈Γ  and φ is an irreducible complex-valued   character  of  C_Γ(x).  To  such  a  pair  ρ=(x,φ)  is associated  an  eigenvalue  of  Frobenius  defined  by  ω_ρ=φ(x)φ(1). Lusztig  then defines a Fourier matrix S₀ whose coefficient is given, for ρ=(x,φ) and ρ'=(x', φ'), by:\n\nS₀_ρρ=C_Γ(x)¹_ρ₁=(x₁φ₁)φ₁(x)φ(y₁)\n\nwhere  the sum is over all pairs ρ₁∈𝓜 (Γ) which are Γ-conjugate to ρ' and  such that y₁ C_Γ(x). This  coefficient also represents the scalar product ρρ_𝐆^F of the corresponding unipotent characters.\n\nA  way to  understand the  formula for  S₀_ρρ better is to consider another  basis of the complex  vector space with basis  𝓜 (Γ), indexed by the  pairs  (x,y)  taken  up  to  Γ-conjugacy,  where  x  and y are commuting  elements  of  Γ.  This  basis  is  called  the basis of Mellin transforms, and given by:\n\n(xy)=_φ Irr(C_Γ(x))φ(y)(xφ)\n\nIn  the  basis  of  Mellin  transforms,  the  linear  map  S₀ is given by (x,y)↦(x⁻¹,y⁻¹)  and  the  linear  transformation  T which sends ρ to ω_ρρ   becomes  (x,y)↦(x,xy).   These  are   particular  cases  of  the permutation  representation of GL₂(ℤ)  on the basis  of Mellin transforms where beginpmatrixabcr cdendpmatrix acts by (x,y)↦(xᵃyᵇ,xᶜyᵈ).\n\nFourier  matrices in finite reductive groups  are given by the above matrix S₀.  But for non-rational Spetses, we use a different matrix S which in the  basis of Mellin transforms  is given by (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x). Equivalently, the formula S_ρρ differs from the formula for S₀_ρρ in that there  is no complex conjugation  of χ₁; thus the  matrix S is equal to S₀ multiplied on the right by the permutation matrix which corresponds to (x,φ)↦(x,φ).

Let Lwϕ  be a reflection subcoset; that  is L is a  parabolic subgroup of W  (the fixator of a subspace of V)  and  w∈  W  is  such  that  wΦ  normalizes L. There are several interesting  cases where the relative group N_W(Lwϕ)L, or a subgroup of it normalizing some further data attached to L, is itself a reflection group.\n\nA first example is the case where ϕ=1 and w=1, W is the Weyl group of a   finite  reductive   group  𝐆^F   and  the   Levi  subgroup  𝐋^F corresponding  to L has a cuspidal unipotent character. Then N_W(L)L is  a  Coxeter  group  acting  on  the  space  X(Z𝐋)⊗ℝ.  A  combinatorial characterization of such parabolic subgroups of Coxeter groups is that they are  normalized by the  longest element of  larger parabolic subgroups (see 5.7.1 Lusztig1976).\n\nA  second  example  is  when  L  is  trivial  and  wϕ is a ζ-regular element,  that is  the ζ-eigenspace  V_ζ of  wϕ contains  a vector outside  all the reflecting hyperplanes of W. Then N_W(Lwϕ)L=C_W(wϕ) is a reflection group in its action on V_ζ.\n\nA similar but more general example is when V_ζ is the ζ-eigenspace of some  element of  the reflection  coset Wϕ,  and is  of maximal dimension among  such ζ-eigenspaces. Then the set of  elements of Wϕ which act by ζ  on  V_ζ  is  a  certain  subcoset  Lwϕ,  and N_W(Lwϕ)L is a reflection group in its action on V_ζ (see 2.5 Lehrer-Springer1999).\n\nFinally,  a  still  more  general  example,  but which only occurs for Weyl groups  or  Spetsial  reflection  groups,  is  when 𝐋 is a ζ-split Levi subgroup  (which means that  the corresponding subcoset  Lwϕ is formed of all  the elements which act by ζ on  some subspace V_ζ of V), and λ is  a  d-cuspidal  unipotent  character  of  𝐋  (which  means  that the multiplicity  of ζ  as a  root of  the degree  of λ  is the same as the multiplicity  of ζ as a root of the generic order of the semi-simple part of  𝐆); then N_W(Lwϕλ)L is a complex reflection group in its action on V_ζ.\n\nFurther,  in the above cases the relative group describes the decomposition of a Lusztig induction.\n\nWhen  𝐆^F is  a finite  reductive group,  and λ  a cuspidal unipotent character  of  the  Levi  subgroup  𝐋^F,  then the 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra  of  the  Harish-Chandra  induced  representation R_𝐋^𝐆(λ) is a Hecke algebra attached to the group N_W(L)L, thus the dimension of the characters  of this group describe the multiplicities in the Harish-Chandra induced.\n\nSimilarly, when 𝐋 is a ζ-split Levi subgroup, and λ is a d-cuspidal unipotent  character of  𝐋 then  (conjecturally) the 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra  of the Lusztig induced R_𝐋^𝐆(λ)  is a cyclotomic Hecke algebra for  to the  group N_W(Lwϕλ)L.  The constituents  of R_𝐋^𝐆(λ) are called  a  ζ-Harish-Chandra  series.  In  the  case of rational groups or cosets,  corresponding to finite  reductive groups, the  conjugacy class of Lwϕ  depends  only  on  the  order  d  of  ζ,  so  one  also talks of d-Harish-Chandra  series. These series correspond to ℓ-blocks where l is  a prime divisor of Φ_d(q) which  does not divide any other cyclotomic factor of the order of 𝐆^F.\n\nThe functions described in this module allow to explore these situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"eigen.html#Gapjm.Eigenspaces.relative_degrees","page":"Eigenspaces","title":"Gapjm.Eigenspaces.relative_degrees","text":"relative_degrees(WF,ζ::Root1=1)\n\nLet  WF be a reflection group or a  reflection coset and ζ be a root of unity.

The particular crystallographic  root systems for Weyl groups  play an important role in mathematics as they classify semi-simple Lie algebras and algebraic groups.\n\nLet  us give precise definitions.  Let V be a  real vector space and Vⱽ its  dual. A root system is a finite set of vectors R⊂ V (the roots), together  with  a  map  r↦  rⱽ  from  R  to  a subset Rⱽ of Vⱽ (the coroots) such that:\n\nFor any r∈ R,  we have rⱽ(r)=2, so  that the formula x↦ x-rⱽ(x)r defines  a  reflection  sᵣ:V→  V  with  root  r  and coroot rⱽ.\nThe reflection sᵣ stabilizes R.\n\nThe  subgroup W=W(R) of GL(V) generated by the reflections sᵣ for r∈ R  is a finite Coxeter  group. We require reduced  root systems, that is such  that the only elements of R colinear  with r∈ R are r and -r; for Weyl groups, we also require that the root system be crystallographic, that is rⱽ(s) is an integer, for any s∈ R,rⱽ∈ Rⱽ.\n\nIf  we identify  V with  Vⱽ by  choosing a  W-invariant bilinear form (.;.),  then we have rⱽ=2r/(r;r). A root system R is irreducible if R   is  not  the  union  of  two  orthogonal  subsets;  equivalently  the representation  of W on the subspace  generated by R is irreducible. If R is reducible then the corresponding Coxeter group is the direct product of the Coxeter groups associated with the irreducible components of R.\n\nLet  us  now  describe  how  a  root  system  R and a presentation of the corresponding  W are encoded in  a Cartan matrix or  a Dynkin diagram. We can  choose a linear  form on V  which does not  vanish on any element of R.  Depending on the sign of the value of this linear form on a root r ∈ R  we call r positive or negative. Then there exists a unique subset Π  of the positive roots, the simple roots, such that any positive root is a linear combination with non-negative coefficients of the roots in Π. Any  two sets of simple roots (corresponding to different choices of linear forms) can be transformed into each other by a unique element of W(R). If S  is  the  set  of  reflections  with  respect to the simple roots, then (W,S)  is  a  Coxeter  system.  These  generating  reflections are called Coxeter generators or simple reflections.\n\nSince the pairing between V and Vⱽ is W-invariant, if Π is a set of simple  roots and if we  define the Cartan matrix  as being the n times n  matrix C={rⱽ(r')}  for r,r'∈Π,  this matrix  is independent of the chosen  linear form  up to  simultaneous permutation  of rows  and columns. Since the action of sᵣ on r' for r,r'∈Π is given by sᵣ(r')=r'-C(r,r')r,   the   Cartan   matrix   determines  the  reflection representation of W.\n\nFor  a crystallographic root system the Cartan matrix has integral entries, and  in the basis Π (completed by a basis of the orthogonal), sᵣ has an integral  matrix.  All  finite-dimensional  (complex)  representations of a finite  Coxeter  group  can  be  realized  over  the field generated by the entries of the Cartan matrix.\n\nThe  Cartan matrix is encoded  in a Dynkin diagram,  a tree with weighted edges  and  an  orientation  on  edges  of  even weight >2, as follows. The vertices are indexed by the simple reflections; an edge is drawn between s and t if the order mₛₜ of st is greater than 2 and is given the weight  mₛₜ. These  weights are  encoded by  drawing the  edge single for weight  3, double for weight 4 and triple for weight 6. The arrows indicate the relative root lengths (going from the longer to the shorter root) which may  differ between different orbits of  W on R. Alternately the Dynkin diagram  can be obtained  from the Cartan  matrix as follows:  if Cᵣₛ and Cₛᵣ  are integers  such that  |Cₛᵣ|≥|Cᵣₛ|=1 there  is an edge of weight |Cₛᵣ|  from r to s  with an arrow pointing  to s if |Cₛᵣ|>1. Note that  the Cartan matrices  we consider here  are not necessarily symmetric, contrary  to the  Cartan matrices  we considered  describing the reflection representation  of a general Coxeter  group; being symmetric corresponds to all roots being taken of the same length.\n\nThe  irreducible  crystallographic  root  systems  are  classified  by  the following  list of Dynkin diagrams. The labeling  of the nodes is the order of the generators and is shown by the function diagram.\n\nAₙ O—O—O—…—O   Bₙ O⇐ O—O—…—O  Cₙ O⇒ O—O—…—O  Dₙ O 2\n   1 2 3 … n      1  2 3 … n     1  2 3 … n     ￨\n                                              O—O—…—O\n                                              1 3 … n\n\nG₂ O⇛ O  F₄ O—O⇒O—O    E₆  O 2    E₇  O 2      E₈  O 2\n   1  2     1 2 3 4        ￨          ￨            ￨\n                       O—O—O—O—O  O—O—O—O—O—O  O—O—O—O—O—O—O\n                       1 3 4 5 6  1 3 4 5 6 7  1 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nWe get the Coxeter diagram, which describes the underlying Weyl group, if we  ignore  the  arrows:  we  see  that  the  root  systems B_n and C_n correspond to the same Coxeter group (the Coxeter diagram is defined by the Coxeter  matrix). Weyl  groups can  also be  characterized as  the finite Coxeter  groups  such  that  all  entries  of  the  Coxeter  matrix  are in {2,3,4,6}.\n\nHere  are the Coxeter diagrams for the  finite Coxeter groups which are not crystallographic (I₂(e) is not crystallographic if e∉ {2,3,4,6}).\n\n       e        5         5\nI₂(e) O—O   H₃ O—O—O  H₄ O—O—O—O\n      1 2      1 2 3     1 2 3 4\n\nThe function cartan gives the cartan matrix for an irreducible root system\n\njulia> cartan(:D,4)\n4×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n  2   0  -1   0\n  0   2  -1   0\n -1  -1   2  -1\n  0   0  -1   2\n\njulia> cartan(:I,2,5) # for type I₂(e) give e as 3rd argument\n2×2 Matrix{Cyc{Int64}}:\n       2  ζ₅²+ζ₅³\n ζ₅²+ζ₅³        2\n\nGiven   two  Cartan  matrices  c1  and  c2,  their  matrix  direct  sum (corresponding  to the  orthogonal direct  sum of  the root systems) can be obtained by cat(c1,c2,dims=[1,2]).\n\nThe  whole  root  system  can  be  recovered  from the simple roots and the corresponding  coroots, since each root  is in the orbit  of a simple root. The  restriction of the simple reflections to the span of R is determined by the Cartan matrix, so R is determined by the Cartan matrix and the set of simple roots.\n\nThe  function  rootdatum  takes  as  arguments  a  matrix r whose lines represents the list of simple roots and another matrix cr whose lines are the  corresponding  coroots  and  produces  a FiniteCoxeterGroup. Such an object  is a permutation group containing  in addition the description of a root  system. cr*transpose(r) should be a  Cartan matrix. Each element of the  coxeter  group  is  represented  as  the permutation it induces on the roots,  coded as a permutation of 1:2N  where we label the positive roots by 1:N, and the negative roots by N+1:2N.\n\nIf a single matrix argument is given to rootdatum it is taken as cr and r  is taken  to be  the identity  matrix; we  get thus  a particular root system  where the  roots are  the canonical  basis of V. For convenience, rootdatum(cartan(t)) can be simplified to coxgroup(t).\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:D,4) # same as rootdatum(cartan(:D,4))\nD₄\n\njulia> cartan(W)\n4×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n  2   0  -1   0\n  0   2  -1   0\n -1  -1   2  -1\n  0   0  -1   2\n\nAlso,  the FiniteCoxeterGroup associated to a direct sum of irreducible root systems can be obtained as\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,2)*coxgroup(:B,2)\nA₂×B₂\n\njulia> cartan(W) # same as cat(cartan(:A,2), cartan(:B,2),dims=[1,2])\n4×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n  2  -1   0   0\n -1   2   0   0\n  0   0   2  -2\n  0   0  -1   2\n\nThe elements of a Weyl group are permutations of the roots:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:D,4)\nD₄\n\njulia> p=W(1,3,2,1,3) # permutes the 24 roots\n(1,14,13,2)(3,17,8,18)(4,12)(5,20,6,15)(7,10,11,9)(16,24)(19,22,23,21)\n\njulia> word(W,p)\n5-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 3\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\nfinally, a benchmark on julia 1.0.2\n\njulia> @btime length(elements(coxgroup(:E,7)))\n  531.385 ms (5945569 allocations: 1.08 GiB)\n\nGAP3 for the same computation takes 2.2s\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"weyl.html#Gapjm.PermRoot.cartan-Tuple{Symbol, Integer, Integer}","page":"Finite Coxeter groups, Weyl groups, crystallographic root systems","title":"Gapjm.PermRoot.cartan","text":"cartan(type, rank [,bond])\n\nthe  Cartan matrix for a  finite Coxeter group described  by type and rank.

Then  take αᵢ  to be the first n vectors  in a basis of V, and take αᵛⱼ to be given in the dual basis by the rows of the matrix left(beginarrayccC₁0 C_2hboxId_d endarrayright) To  C we associate a reflection group  in the space V, generated by the fundamental  reflections  rᵢ  given  by  rᵢ(v)=v-(αᵛᵢ,v)αᵢ. This is a Coxeter  group, called the affine Weyl group ilde W associated to W when we start with the affine Cartan matrix associated to a Weyl group W.\n\nThe  affine Weyl  group is  infinite; it  has one additional generator s₀ (the  reflection with respect to α₀) compared  to W. We can not use 0 as  a label  by default  for a  generator of  a Coxeter  group (because the default  labels are used as indices, and indices start at 1 in Julia) so we label it as n+1 where n is the numbers of generators of W.\n\njulia> W=affine(coxgroup(:A,4))\nÃ₄\n\njulia> diagram(W)\n       ————5————\n      /         \\\nÃ₄   1———2———3———4\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"kl.html#Kazhdan-Lusztig-polynomials-and-bases","page":"Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and bases","title":"Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and bases","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"kl.html","page":"Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and bases","title":"Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and bases","text":"Pages=[\"kl.md\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"kl.html","page":"Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and bases","title":"Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and bases","text":"KL\nKLPol\nKL.critical_pair\nTbasis(::KL.HeckeCpElt)\nCbasis\nCpbasis\ncharacter\nrepresentation(::LeftCell,H)\nWGraphToRepresentation\nWgraph\nleft_cells\nLeftCell\nLusztigaw\nLusztigAw\nAsymptoticAlgebra","category":"page"},{"location":"kl.html#Gapjm.KL","page":"Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and bases","title":"Gapjm.KL","text":"This  module defines Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and bases, and computes W-graphs and asymptotic algebras.\n\nLet  ℋ be  the Iwahori-Hecke algebra  of a Coxeter  system (W,S), with quadratic  relations (Tₛ-uₛ₀)(Tₛ-uₛ₁)=0  for s∈  S. If  -uₛ₀uₛ₁ has a square  root  wₛ,  we  can  scale  the  basis  Tₛ  to  get  a new basis tₛ=-Tₛ/wₛ    with   quadratic    relations   (tₛ-vₛ)(tₛ+vₛ⁻¹)=0   where vₛ=wₛ/uₛ₁.   The  most  general  case   when  Kazhdan-Lusztig  bases  and polynomials  can be defined is when the parameters vₛ belong to a totally ordered abelian group Γ for multiplication, see Lusztig1983.  We set  Γ⁺= {γ∈  Γ∣γ>0} and Γ⁻={γ⁻¹∣γ∈ Γ⁺}={γ∈ Γ∣γ<0}.\n\nThus  we assume ℋ defined over the ring ℤ[Γ], the group algebra of Γ over  ℤ, and the quadratic  relations of ℋ  associate to each s∈ S a vₛ∈  Γ⁺ such that  (tₛ-vₛ)(tₛ+vₛ⁻¹)=0. We also  set qₛ=vₛ² and define the  basis Tₛ=vₛtₛ with quadratic relations (Tₛ-qₛ)(Tₛ+1)=0; for w∈ W with reduced expression w=s₁…sₙ we define q_w Γ by q_w^½=v_s₁v_sₙ and let q_w=(q_w^½)²; we have T_w=q_w^½t_w.\n\nWe  define the bar involution on ℋ  by linearity: on ℤ[Γ] we define it by  overline_γ Γa_γγ= _γ Γ a_γ γ¹ and we extend it to ℋ by  overline T_s=T_s^-1  (equivalently \\overline t_s=t_s^{-1}). Then the Kazhdan-Lusztig basisC^′_wis defined as the only basis ofℋ stable by  the bar  involution and  congruent tot_wmodulo∑_{w∈ W}Γ⁻.t_w`.\n\nThe  basis  C^_w  can  be  computed  as  follows.  We  define  elements R_xy  of ℤ[Γ] by  T_y¹=_x overlineR_xy¹ q_x¹T_x. We then  define inductively  the Kazhdan-Lusztig  polynomials (in this general context  we should say the Kazhdan-Lusztig elements of ℤ[Γ], which belong to the subalgebra of ℤ[Γ] generated by the qₛ) by P_xw=τ_(q_wq_x)^½  (_xywR_xyP_yw)  where  τ  is the truncation:  τ_nu _γ  Γ a_γγ=  _γnua_γγ; the  induction is thus on decreasing x for the Bruhat order and starts at P_ww=1. We have then C^_w=_y q_w^-12 P_ywT_y.\n\nThe  Chevie code  for the  Kazhdan-Lusztig bases  C, D and their primed versions,  was originally  written by  Andrew Mathas  around 1994, who also contributed  to  the  design  of  the programs dealing with Kazhdan-Lusztig bases. He also implemented some other bases, such as the Murphy basis which we  also implement. The code for the case of unequal parameters was written around  1999 by F.Digne  and J.Michel. The  other Kazhdan-Lusztig bases are computed in terms of the C′ basis.\n\nWhen  the ℤ[Γ] is a  Laurent polynomial ring the  bar operation is taking the  inverse of  the variables,  and truncation  is keeping terms of degree smaller or equal to that of ν. It is possible to use arbitrary groups Γ as   long   as   methods   bar:_γ   Γ   a_γγ  _γ  Γ  a_γγ¹, positive_part  : _γ  Γ a_γγ  _γ 1  a_γγ and negative_part: _γ  Γ  a_γγ    _γ  1  a_γγ  have been defined on ℤ[Γ]. These operations   will   be   used   internally   by  the  programs  to  compute Kazhdan-Lusztig bases.\n\nWe provide also functionality to study the Kazhdan-Lusztig left cells (for the equal-parameter Hecke algebra).\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:H,3)\nH₃\n\njulia> c=left_cells(W)\n22-element Vector{LeftCell{FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Cyc{Int64}}}}:\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo= character=φ₁‚₀>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=123 character=φ₁‚₁₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(15) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(10) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(14) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=7 character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(12) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(9,12) character=φ₅‚₂>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(5,11) character=φ₅‚₂>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=13 character=φ₅‚₂>\n ⋮\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(8,13) character=φ₃‚₆+φ₃‚₈>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(1,15) character=φ₃‚₆+φ₃‚₈>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=3 character=φ₃‚₁+φ₃‚₃>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=2 character=φ₃‚₁+φ₃‚₃>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=1 character=φ₃‚₁+φ₃‚₃>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=6 character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(13) character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(11) character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=9 character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n\nsee  also the  functions elements,  character, representation and  Wgraph for left cells.

For Iwahori-Hecke algebras  and G(d,1,1) this module also implements  the standard T basis;  see the module KLfor Kazhdan-Lusztig bases.\n\nLet  (W,S) be  a Coxeter  system and  let mₛₜ  be the order of st for s,t∈ S. Let R be a commutative ring with 1 and for s∈ S let uₛ₀,uₛ₁∈ R be elements which depend only on the conjugacy class of s in W (this is  the  same  as  requiring  that  uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ  whenever  mₛₜ is odd). The Iwahori-Hecke   algebra  of  W  over  R  with  parameters  uₛᵢ  is  a deformation  of the group algebra of W over R defined as follows: it is the  unitary  associative  R-algebra  generated  by  elements  Tₛ, s∈ S subject to the relations:\n\n(Tₛ-uₛ₀)(Tₛ-uₛ₁)=0 for all s∈ S (the quadratic relations)\n\nTₛTₜTₛ= TₜTₛTₜ with mₛₜ factors on each side (the braid relations)\n\nIf  uₛ₀=1 and  uₛ₁=-1 for  all s  then the quadratic relations become Tₛ²=1 and the deformation of the group algebra is trivial.\n\nSince  the generators Tₛ  satisfy the braid  relations, H is  in fact a quotient  of the group algebra of the  braid group associated with W. The braid relations also imply that for any reduced expression s_1⋯ s_m of w ∈  W the product Tₛ_1⋯ Tₛ_m has the same value, that we denote T_w. We have T_1=1; if one of the uₛᵢ is invertible, the {T_w}_{w∈ W} form an R-basis  of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra  which specializes to the canonical basis of the group algebra R[W] for uₛ₀↦1 and uₛ₁↦-1.\n\nWhen  one  of  the  uₛᵢ  is  invertible,  the  structure  constants  (the decomposion  of  a  product  T_vT_w)  in  the T_w basis are obtained as follows.  Choose a reduced expression for v,  say v=s_1 ⋯ s_k and apply inductively the formula:\n\nT_sT_w=T_sw               if l(sw)=l(w)+1\n\nT_sT_w=-uₛ₀uₛ₁T_sw+(uₛ₀+uₛ₁)T_w if l(sw)=l(w)-1.\n\nIf  one of uₛ₀ or uₛ₁ is invertible  in R, for example uₛ₁, then by changing  the generators  to T′ₛ=-Tₛ/uₛ₁,  and setting qₛ=-uₛ₀/uₛ₁, the braid  relations do no change  (since when mₛₜ is  odd we have uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ) but  the quadratic relations become (T′ₛ-qₛ)(T′ₛ+1)=0. This normalisation is  the most common form considered  in the literature. Another common form in  the context of  Kazhdan-Lusztig theory, is  uₛ₀=√qₛ and uₛ₁=-√qₛ⁻¹. The  form provided, with two parameters per generator, is often useful, for instance  when constructing  the Jones  polynomial. If  for all s we have uₛ₀=q,   uₛ₁=-1   then   we   call   the   corresponding   algebra  the \"one-parameter\" or \"Spetsial\" Iwahori-Hecke algebra associated with W.\n\nFor  some  Iwahori-Hecke  algebras  the  character  table,  and  in general Kazhdan-Lusztig  bases, require  a square  root of  -uₛ₀uₛ₁. These square roots  can be specified  with the keyword  rootpara when constructing the algebra;  after  this  the  function  rootpara(H)  will return the chosen roots. If not specified, we try to extract roots automatically when needed; rootpara(H)  informs  on  the  choices  made. Note that some mathematical results  require an explicit choice of one  of the two possible roots which cannot be automatically made thus require a keyword initialisation.\n\nThere  is a universal choice  for R and uₛᵢ:  Let uₛᵢ:s∈ S,i∈[0,1] be indeterminates   such  that  uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ  whenever  mₛₜ  is  odd,  and  let A=ℤ[uₛᵢ] be the corresponding polynomial ring. Then the Hecke algebra H of  W over A with parameters uₛᵢ is called the generic Iwahori-Hecke algebra  of  W.  Any  Hecke  algebra  H₁  with parameters vₛᵢ can be obtained  by  specialization  from  H,  since  there  is  a  unique  ring homomorphism  f:A → R such that f(uₛᵢ)=vₛᵢ for all i. Then via f we can identify H₁ to R _A H.\n\nCertain invariants of the irreducible characters of the one-parameter Hecke algebra  play a special role in the representation theory of the underlying finite  Coxeter  groups,  namely  the  a-  and  A-invariants. For basic properties   of  Iwahori-Hecke   algebras  and   their  relevance   to  the representation theory of finite groups of Lie type, see for example Curtis and Reiner 1987 Sections~67 and 68.\n\nIn  the  following  example,  we  compute  the multiplication table for the 0-Iwahori–Hecke algebra associated with the Coxeter group of type A_2.\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,2)\nA₂\n\njulia> H=hecke(W,0)            # One-parameter algebra with `q=0`\nhecke(A₂,0)\n\njulia> T=Tbasis(H);            # Create the `T` basis\n\njulia> b=T.(elements(W))       # the basis\n6-element Vector{HeckeTElt{HeckeAlgebra{Int64, Perm{Int16}, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}, Int64, Perm{Int16}}}:\n T.\n T₁\n T₂\n T₁₂\n T₂₁\n T₁₂₁\n\njulia> b*permutedims(b)       # multiplication table\n6×6 Matrix{HeckeTElt{HeckeAlgebra{Int64, Perm{Int16}, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}, Int64, Perm{Int16}}}:\n T.

We will see that this also works on the level of characters and representations.\n\nFor  general complex reflection  groups, the picture  is similar. The Hecke algebras  are deformations  of the  group algebras,  generalizing those for real reflection groups.\n\nThe  definition is  as a  quotient of  the algebra  of the  braid group. We assume  now that W is  a finite reflection group  in the complex vector space  V. The braid group associated  is the fundamental group Π₁ of the  space  (V-bigcup_Hinmathcal H  H)W, where mathcal H is  the set of  reflecting hyperplanes of  W. This group  is generated by braid reflections, elements which by the natural map from the braid group to  the reflection  group project  to distinguished  reflections. The braid reflections   which  project  to  a  given  W-orbit  of  reflections  are conjugate.  Let 𝐬 be a representative of  such a conjugacy class of braid reflections,  let e  be the  order of  the image  of 𝐬  in W, and let u_𝐬0u_𝐬e-1 be indeterminates. The generic Hecke algebra of W is  the  ℤu_𝐬i^  1_𝐬i-algebra  quotient  of  the braid group algebra  by the relations (𝐬-u_𝐬0)(𝐬-u_𝐬e-1)=0, and an arbitrary Hecke  algebra for W is an algebra  obtained from this generic algebra by specializing some of the parameters.\n\nThe  generic Hecke algebras are explicitely  described by a presentation of the  braid group. The braid group can be presented by homogeneous relations in   the  braid   reflections,  called   braid  relations,  described  in Broué-Malle-Rouquier     1998     and    Bessis-Michel 2003  (some  of  which  were  obtained  using the VKCURVE GAP3-package,  also ported to Julia).  Furthermore, these presentations are such  that the  reflection group  is presented  by the same relations, plus relations  describing the order  of the generating  reflections, called the order  relations. Thus  the Hecke  algebra has  a presentation similar to that of W, with the same braid relations but the order relations replaced by a deformed version.\n\nIf  S⊂ W  is the  set of  distinguished reflections  of W which lift to generating  braid reflections in the braid  group, for each conjugacy class of  an  s  of  order  e  we take indeterminates uₛ₀,…,uₛₑ₋₁. Then the generic  Hecke algebra is the ℤuₛᵢ^1ₛᵢ-algebra H with generators T_s  for each s∈  S presented by  the braid relations  and the deformed order relations (T_s-u_s0)(T_s-u_se-1)=0.\n\nAriki,  Koike and Malle have computed the  character table of some of these algebras,  including  those  for  all  2-dimensional reflection groups, see Broué-Malle 1993 and Malle 1996; our data  has  models  of  all  representation  and  character  tables for real reflection  groups; it  contains the  same for  imprimitive groups  and for primitive groups of dimension 2 and 3 (these last representations have been computed  in Malle-Michel 2010) and contains also models and  character tables computed  by Michel for  G₂₉ and G₃₃; it contains also  partial lists of representations and partial character tables for the remaining  groups G₃₁,G₃₂  and G₃₄,  computed by  Malle and  Michel for G₃₂ and by Michel for the other two algebras.\n\nThe quotient of the Hecke algebra obtained by the specialisation u_𝐬i ζₑⁱ  is isomorphic to the group algebra of W. It was conjectured for 20 years  that over a splitting ring the Hecke algebra is itself isomorphic to the  group algebra of W over the  same ring. This was called the freeness conjecture since the main problem is to show that the Hecke algebra is free of dimension |W|. This has finally been proved in 2019 thanks to the work of  many  people  including  Marin,  Pfeiffer,  Chavli  and  Tsuchioka  for exceptional  groups. Along the way  it has been proven  that there exists a set  {b_w}_{w∈ W} of  elements of the  Braid group such  that b_1=1 and b_w maps to w by the natural quotient map, such that their images T_w form a basis of the Hecke algebra.\n\nIt  is  conjectured  that  such  a  basis  T_w  can  be  chosen such that additionnaly  the  linear  form  t  defined  by  t(T_w)=0 if w≠ 1 and t(1)=1 is a symmetrizing form for the symmetric algebra H. This is well known  for all real reflection groups  and has been proved in Malle-Mathas 1998   for   imprimitive   reflection   groups   and   in Malle-Michel 2010 for some primitive groups of dimension 2  and  3.  Chlouveraki  and  Chavli  have handled some other 2-dimensional cases.  For  each  irreducible  character  φ  of H we define the Schur element  Sᵩ associated to φ by the  condition that for any element T of  H we have t(T)=∑ᵩ φ(T)/Sᵩ. It  can be shown that the Schur elements are  Laurent polynomials, and they  do not depend on  the choice of a basis having  the  above  property.  Malle  has  computed  these  Schur elements, assuming the above conjecture; they are in the Chevie data.\n\nSee the function hecke for various ways of specifying the parameters of a Hecke   algebra.

If no parameter is given, 1 is assumed which gives the group algebra of W.\n\nThe  following forms are accepted for  parameter: if parameter is not a vector or a tuple, it is replaced by the vector fill(parameter,ngens(W)). If it is a vector with one entry, it is replaced with fill(parameter[1],ngens(W)).  If parameter  is a  vector with more than one  entry, it should  have length ngens(W),  each entry representing the parameters   for   the   corresponding   generator   of  W,  and  entries corresponding  to  the  same  W-orbit  of generators should be identical. Finally, if parameter is a Tuple, the tuple should have as many entries as  there are hyperplane  orbits in W  and each entry  will represent the parameters for the corresponding conjugacy class of braid reflections.\n\nAn  entry in  parameter for  a reflection  of order  e can  be either a single scalar value or a Vector of length 'e'. If it is a Vector, it is interpreted as the list [u₀,…,u_(e-1)] of parameters for that reflection. If  it is not  a vector, let  q be its  value; it is  then interpreted as specifying  the  list  of  parameters  for  the Spetsial algebra, which are [q,ζ_e,…,ζ_{e-1}]  (thus the  list [q,-1]  of the one-parameter algebra for Coxeter groups).\n\nWhen  printing an Hecke algebra the parameter list is abbreviated using the same conventions.\n\nComputing characters or representations of Hecke algebra needs sometimes to extract  roots of the  parameters. These roots  are extracted automatically (when  possible). For Coxeter groups it  is possible to give explicit roots by  giving  a  keyword  argument  rootpara:  if  it is a vector it should contain at the i-th position a square root of -parameter[i][1]*parameter[i][2];   if  a   scalar  it   is  replaced  by fill(rootpara,ngens(W)).\n\nExample\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:B,2)\nB₂\n\njulia> @Pol q\nPol{Int64}: q\n\njulia> H=hecke(W,q)\nhecke(B₂,q)\n\njulia> H.para\n2-element Vector{Vector{Pol{Int64}}}:\n [q, -1]\n [q, -1]\n\njulia> H=hecke(W,q^2,rootpara=-q)\nhecke(B₂,q²,rootpara=-q)\n\njulia> H=hecke(W,q^2)\nhecke(B₂,q²)\n\njulia> rootpara(H)\n2-element Vector{Pol{Int64}}:\n q\n q\n\njulia> H\nhecke(B₂,q²,rootpara=q)\n\njulia> H=hecke(W,[q^2,q^4],rootpara=[q,q^2])\nhecke(B₂,Pol{Int64}[q², q⁴],rootpara=Pol{Int64}[q, q²])\n\njulia> H.para,rootpara(H)\n(Vector{Pol{Int64}}[[q², -1], [q⁴, -1]], Pol{Int64}[q, q²])\n\njulia> H=hecke(W,9,rootpara=3)\nhecke(B₂,9,rootpara=3)\n\njulia> H.para,rootpara(H)\n([[9, -1], [9, -1]], [3, 3])\n\njulia> @Mvp x,y,z,t\n\njulia> H=hecke(W,[[x,y]])\nhecke(B₂,Vector{Mvp{Int64, Int64}}[[x, y]])\n\njulia> rootpara(H);H\nhecke(B₂,Vector{Mvp{Int64, Int64}}[[x, y]],rootpara=ζ₄x½y½)\n\njulia> H=hecke(W,[[x,y],[z,t]])\nhecke(B₂,Vector{Mvp{Int64, Int64}}[[x, y], [z, t]])\n\njulia> rootpara(H);H\nhecke(B₂,Vector{Mvp{Int64, Int64}}[[x, y], [z, t]],rootpara=Mvp{Cyc{Int64}, Rational{Int64}}[ζ₄x½y½, ζ₄t½z½])\n\njulia> hecke(coxgroup(:F,4),(q,q^2)).para\n4-element Vector{Vector{Pol{Int64}}}:\n [q, -1]\n [q, -1]\n [q², -1]\n [q², -1]\n\njulia> hecke(complex_reflection_group(3,1,2),q).para # spetsial parameters\n2-element Vector{Vector{Pol{Cyc{Int64}}}}:\n [q, ζ₃, ζ₃²]\n [q, -1]\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"hecke.html#Gapjm.HeckeAlgebras.Tbasis-Tuple{HeckeAlgebra}","page":"Hecke algebras","title":"Gapjm.HeckeAlgebras.Tbasis","text":"Tbasis(H::HeckeAlgebra) The  T basis of  H.

Note  that 'A:=SolomonAlgebra(W,K)' is endowed with the following fields:\n\n'A.W': the group W\n\n'A.basis': the basis (x_I)_{I ⊂ S}.\n\n'A.xbasis':  the function sending the subset I (written as a number: for instance 124 for [s_1,s_2,s_4]) to x_I.\n\n'A.ybasis': the function sending the subset I to y_I.\n\n'A.injection':  the injection of A in the group algebra of W, obtained by calling 'SolomonAlgebraOps.injection(A)'.\n\nNote that 'SolomonAlgebra(W,K)' endows W with the field W.solomon which is a record containing the following fields:\n\n'W.solomon_subsets': the set of subsets of S\n\n'W.solomonconjugacy':  conjugacy classes  of parabolic  subgroups of W (a conjugacy   class  is  represented  by  the   list  of  the  positions,  in 'W.solomon.subsets', of the subsets I of S such that `WI` lies in this conjugacy class).\n\n'W.solomon_mackey':  essentially  the  structure  constants  of  the Solomon algebra over the rationals.\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:B,4)\nB₄\n\njulia> A=SolomonAlgebra(W)\nSolomonAlgebra(B₄,Int64)\n\njulia> X=A.xbasis; X(1,2,3)*X(2,4)\n2X₂+2X₄\n\njulia> W.solomon_subsets\n16-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:\n [1, 2, 3, 4]\n [1, 2, 3]\n [1, 2, 4]\n [1, 3, 4]\n [2, 3, 4]\n [1, 2]\n [1, 3]\n [1, 4]\n [2, 3]\n [2, 4]\n [3, 4]\n [1]\n [2]\n [3]\n [4]\n []\n\njulia> W.solomon_conjugacy\n12-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:\n [1]\n [2]\n [3]\n [4]\n [5]\n [6]\n [7, 8]\n [9, 11]\n [10]\n [12]\n [13, 14, 15]\n [16]\n\njulia> Algebras.injection(A)(X(1,2,3))\ne_+e₄+e₃₄+e₂₃₄+e₁₂₃₄+e₂₁₂₃₄+e₃₂₁₂₃₄+e₄₃₂₁₂₃₄\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"}]
